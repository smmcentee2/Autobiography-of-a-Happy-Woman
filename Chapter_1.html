         <p>Are there any happy women left on this good green earth? </p>
         
         <p>One is constrained to ask because we are uni&#x2013;
            versally told that half the world in in rebel&#x2013;
            lion&#x2014;the woman half. Married women in the
            cage want to break in. In fact, half
            a wolrd of women are supposed to be wailing
            because they can't spend life in a sort of 
            dolce far niente <a id="n7" href="#dolcefarniente">*</a> 
            dream with both hands folded idly
            in their laps. I say supposed, because, as
            a matter of fact in real life, you know and I
            know that the workers are the happy ones&#x2014;
            married or single&#x2014;the workers are the ones
            who sing; the idle the ones who wail.</p>
         
         <p>We are told&#x2014;just as if the world hadn't
            known that fact for countless years&#x2014;that the 
            highest duty of life is manufacturing new hu&#x2013;
            man beings&#x2014;alias babies; and that women are
            in open revolt against this duty. Yet as a 
            matter of fact&#x2014;not platform twaddle&#x2014;not
            pyrotechnics to catch the vote of lustful men
            &#x2014;we know that the supply of love&#x2013;born babies
            is not dropping off; and that, for the first time
            in the history of the race, as much thought 
            and care are given to keeping the babies, that
            are born, alive as to keeping up the birth 
            rate of hypothetical unborn babies.</p>
         
         <p>We are told by investigating commissions
            that women, who work behind the counter,
            over the typewriter, over the dish pan, in the
            school room, above the loom, in the factory,
            behind the broom are slaves of new industrial 
            conditions; that they are desperately un&#x2013;
            happy; that when the first gray hairs come, 
            the iron has entered into their sould, or some&#x2013;
            thing like that. (If the iron went as tonic in
            fishy blood, and gave some kick to the whine
            for self pity&#x2014;a lifting kick, we'll say&#x2014;there
            might be some point to it.) But the women
            that you know and I know&#x2014;outside the peo&#x2013;
            ple on the job at so much per for investigating
            commissions&#x2014;behind the counter, over the
            typewriter, above the loom, behind the broom;
            the women, who do things in the home or out
            of it, <em>who stand for plus, not minus,</em> for per&#x2013;
            formers, not parasites&#x2013;are not idly poking
            irons of introspection in and out of their souls.
            They literally don't understand what all this
            talk hubbub is about. Big talk: little do&#x2014;
            I have heard some of them say.</p>
         
         <p>I am a woman; and I am living in the thick
            of life; and I have seen all sides of it; and I
            have worked at high pace and high pressure
            with fury and joy in the home and out of it;
            and I do not find this wail of woe purporting
            to come from womanhood rings true. It is
            not true of me. It is not true of the women, 
            who work, that I know. The women I know
            who work&#x2014;don't find love ashes of roses; nor
            ashes of Sodom; nor joy, a fading phantom.
            Life to the worker is a dream come true, with
            nightmare giants of troubled sleep, some&#x2013;
            times, of course; but always at dawn, fear fad&#x2013;
            ing in light. I am not writing this because of
            the standing policy of the average American
            editor&#x2014;to make all stories end happily. I am
            not writing a story. I am setting down the 
            actual facts of a life begun under handicap;
            and I want to set down that the older I grow,
            the more I find life a more beautiful thing
            than all the school girl gush and pointless
            longings of what the poets call youth.
            No matter how hard we think our own special han&#x2013;
            dicap has been&#x2014;poverty, or inherited disease, 
            or the tradegy of wrong parenthood, or a per&#x2013;
            sonality hopelessly askew&#x2014;I do not think any
            life ever came into this world without its own
            handicap. Why we are handicapped&#x2014;who can
            tell? It may be to compel the soul to work
            out its own hardihood getting rid of the hand&#x2013;
            icap, or to commit suicide sinking under it.
            When I call life a dream come true, it is not
            in blindness to the wrecks and tradegies and
            crimes that litter every foot of life's progress.
            I know there are more tradegies hidden mute
            in the home than ever wer shouted from the 
            housetops by the Sisterhood of Disontent <a id="n3" href="#Sisterhood of Discontent">*</a>
            ; but I know alos how much of this waste of the
            gift of life results from the collision with the
            hidden handicap of the personality.</p>
         
         <p>Having found life a dream come true, I ask
            myself (as I know multitudes of women work&#x2013;
            ers inside and outside the home are asking
            themselves) is all this wail of woe genuine? Is
            the old world vocal of womanhood out of joint?
            Is there a great Sisterhood of Discontent? Or
            is it that we are so attuned to the wail of dis&#x2013;
            content that we fail to note a world vocal with 
            the music of the spheres; joy at work; service
            rendered in gladness, not grudgingly; zest of
            life; reapers garnering sheaves in sunlight;
            women laughing with children at play?</p>
         
         <p>The new mental attitude to life has come so
            unexpectedly that it has left some ancient sex&#x2013;
            poses forever behind; the wife&#x2013;beater calling
            himself woman's natural protector,and at
            once proceeding to break her protected head;
            the sheep&#x2013;type of woman pretending she likes
            that kind of protection; Amelia <a id="n1" href="#Amelia">*</a> 
            fainting with terror of her own safety in the arms of the 
            wicked <a id="n2" href="#DonJuan">*</a> 
            ;Don Juanpretending he is 
            a very devil of a fellow engaged in the busi&#x2013;
            ness of eating babies in the dark! Without
            knowing it, we have somehow come to regard
            self&#x2013;pity as the beggar's hat of a mean spirit
            stuck out for alms.The Heroine of old (she,
            herslef, was never by any possibilty supposed
            to be half&#x2013;past sixteen)set out joyously, coyly,
            I was going to say unblushingly&#x2014;only, she 
            was really supposed to blush bucketfuls&#x2014;to
            harpoon a man for her support; if a little
            soulful longing were mixed in as a prime
            flavor. To&#x2013;;day, we tear that pose to ten thou&#x2013;
            sand analytic tatters. What's she after?
            What can she do?What's she going to 
            give in return besides sweet smiles and sug&#x2013;
            ared drafts on the family cash box?And 
            if all she has to offer is sex, all draped in 
            wistaria and roses and wistful soul longings,
            of course, we aren't suprised that she gets
            spurious coin back in return, bronze and cop&#x2013;
            per and brass and putty, where she expected 
            pure gold.</p>
         
         <p>Quite unknown to ourselves as a generation,
            we have come to eye the parasite askance, be 
            she rich or poor. It doesn't matter whether 
            she belongs to the orchid or to the mosquito
            family. The woman, who is sorry for herself
            because she has to earn her living <em>outside</em>the
            home, is the very woman, who would be sorry
            for herself earning her living <em>inside</em>the home.
            If she is sorry for herself in an office, what
            would she be in the pangs of giving birth to a
            new life?</p>
         
         <p>My early days were passed in a Western
            city during the depression of the collapse from 
            one of the worst real estate booms, that ever
            sent a whole community up in a crazy ballon
            of inflated hopes, only to drop them in a ten 
            years' slough of reaction. I remember one
            speculator, who became a paper millionaire in 
            anticipation of a railroad coming in, who, six
            months after the advent of the new line, was
            carried away to an asylum, where he passed
            the rest of his days bent almost double pick&#x2013;
            ing up imaginary diamonds. A politician in 
            the same place, who between dawn and dark
            unexpectedly as a bolt out of the blue, had
            made his half million, built a palace calling it
            after some castle or other. When the boom
            collapsed, he hadn't money enough of those
            paper thousands to light the fire in his fur&#x2013;
            nace. He had to borrow money to leave the 
            country.</p>
         
         <p>In your mind, draw a line on the map from
            St.Louis<a id="n4" href="#St. Louis">*</a> to 
            St.Paul <a id="n5" href="#St. Paul">*</a>. 
            The depression pre&#x2013; vailing in our city was typical of conditions in
            every little new hamlet west of that line from
            the tme of the Panic of 1893 up to 1898. At the
            time, we were all desperately sorry for our &#x2013;
            selves. It isn't a pleasant awakening to think
            you have a lot worth 120,000, and to find in
            a day that what you really have is a mortgage
            debt for 12,000, against property, which carries
            taxes of 3,000 a year. We were all desperate&#x2013;
            ly sorry for ourselves. Yet, looking back, we
            can all laugh at the hardships. We didn't 
            laugh then. We hustled. Actual hunger never
            came within the majority of homes; but it came
            so near the doors that I can guess and have 
            often as a child dreamed what the Phantom
            Frightlooks like when it stalks out of the dark
            to sping at the struggler's throat. There
            was one dream I used to have over and over
            in the darkest years of the city's collapse. It
            was of a half&#x2013;naked figure flying along the
            edge of a precipice with two wolves snapping
            at its heels; and I do not think there were many
            people in the city at that time, who did not
            know what the sensations of the runner must
            have been. We were all, every one of us, on
            the edge.</p>
         
         <p>Though hunger never actually entered most
            of the homes, it came horribly near many a
            home that kept a brave front face to the street.
            We laugh when reminiscent now. We didn't
            laugh then. I think it was the Spirit of the
            West that sustained us buoyantly under condi&#x2013;
            tions that would have plunged an older commu&#x2013;
            nity into slums. There were carefully nur&#x2013;
            tured women, who would have gone hungry
            that first year of the Panic, if husbands and
            brothers had not been good shots to keep the
            family larder filled with prairie chicken and
            ducks. I know of one woman who, for six
            weeks before her first child was born, lived
            alone in a prairie shanty on the outskirts of
            the city with nothing to eat but potato meal.
            An editor, who at the time represented the
            city in the Federal Government and who used
            to cheer the community's heart by thunderous
            editorials on the glorious of the West,
            would have gone hungry that winter of '93if
            the boyshad not suspected that the old
            manlooked gaunt. They got up a shooting
            party and sent him a present of half a dozen
            barrels of wild geese. I have heard him in
            his cupscurse the hands that were feeding
            him; but nobody replied; and nobody told; and
            the friendships cemented in such hardships
            were embedded in a reinforced concrete.</p>
         
         <p>I am stating these circumstances to make it
            clear that we were face to face with <em>realitites,
               </em>not <em>theories</em>; and <em>the beautiful thing about a
               reality is that it never lies.</em> You learn to look 
            at facts without blinders; without side&#x2013;step&#x2013;
            ping or flinching. A woman, who has always
            lived the mural existence of a protected home,
            is so terribly apt to mistake what <em>"she thinks"</em>
            for great fact of <em>"what is."</em> If she doesn't
            like a fact, she shuts her eyes to it. You can't
            do that when you are bumping into facts that
            you don't like. So it was not all a disadvant&#x2013;
            tage that the hard times taught us to face facts
            unflinchingly.</p>
         
         <p>One of the curious features of the collapse
            was its reaction on what the study chair the&#x2013;
            orists call woman's sphere. Those were the
            days, when all the public prints were full of
            blasts and counterblasts of argument as to 
            whether woman ought to go out of the home to 
            become a wage&#x2013;earner. We hadn't time for
            those arguments then in the West. We were
            not confronted with arguments. We were face
            to face with hunger. We had to work, or
            starve. Ought not woman to stay in her
            own sphere of manufacturing babies?the dis&#x2013;
            putants would has truculently. We hadn't any
            time to answer. We had to go out and work,
            or see the babies, that were already manufac&#x2013;
            tured, go hungry. <em>It seems to me that is typi&#x2013;;
               cal of the whole woman movement. It isn't a
               rebellion, a revolt, a megalomania of individ&#x2013;
               ualism run riot, the morbid monstrosity of a 
               woman trying to be a man, to grow side&#x2013;whis&#x2013;
               kers and wear trousers. It is a new economic
               arena, into which woman has been forcibly
               pushed by unbending necessity.</em></p>
         
         <p>Let me give some more examples of that ne&#x2013;
            cessity. In three weeks in that city eleven
            hundred real estate agents closed their offices
            and took down their signs. What do you sup&#x2013;
            pose the real estate agents' families did about
            bread and butter just then? The doctor, who
            became the most famous surgeon west of the
            Mississippi <a id="n6" href="#Mississippi">*</a>
            preceding the fame of the Mayos,
            told me that he slept on the chairs in his of&#x2013;
            fice that winter, and except for one mid&#x2013;day
            meal, lived on peanuts and beer and hot Scotch.
            He died in receipt of an income of 100,000a
            year, of a disease contracted in those starva&#x2013;
            tion days; but what do you imagine his old
            mother and two elderly sisters, whom he was
            thought to be supporting, did during that hard
            stress? They went out as wage earners&#x2014;I
            shall not say how; for that is their affair, not
            mine;but, to me, the funny feature of it was 
            that this same doctor was a most uncompro&#x2013;
            missing foe to the woman movement. If his
            mother and sisters had not worked, he would 
            not have had even that one mid&#x2013;day meal.</p>
         
         <p>I think of another case, a convent-bred girl,
            buxom, clean, laughing, good-natured, capable,
            with stolid, solid but at the same time the most
            passionate belief that a woman's only sphere
            was to be a loving wide and a most multitudi&#x2013;
            nous mother. It is funny how life knocks our 
            little self&#x2013;appointed missions on the head; and
            when the half&#x2013;gods go, beats us, prods us, bay&#x2013;
            onets us up to the altars on our knees before
            the true! Just when the boom collapsed, this
            girl's father came to his death either by suicide,
            or falling in front of a train. Her mother 
            attested her gried by at once buying on credit 
            about 2000dollars worth of deepest
            mourning. It was found that the life insur&#x2013;
            ance has lapsed and the whole estate amounted
            to a horrible minus plus nine younger chil&#x2013;
            dren to fed. If this girl had not thrown her 
            theories to the winds, and plunged into the 
            arena of the wage&#x2014;earners, the home would
            have been seized by the sheriff and the family
            turned on the street. She had to take care of
            the babies already born, and let the unborn
            ones take care of themselves. SHe taught kin&#x2013;
            dergarten, coached French, helped a convent
            in German, and laughed and danced her way
            along uner the load, and worked doggedly at
            paying those debts, besides educating and sup&#x2013;
            porting the other nine till they could support
            themselves. At thirty eight she married an
            Englishman, with a right to sin in the House
            of Lords. Society sat up aghast, then received
            her with open arms.</p>
         
         <p> <em>How</em>did she do it?one shoddy disap&#x2013;
            pointed mother asked.</p>
         
         <p> She didn't do it. It was <em>what she was</em>did
            it,I tried to explain. Your little mission,
            what you set out to do doesn't matter. <em>It is
               what you are, what you become in what you
               do that wins or loses life's game for you.</em> Why
            did <em>he</em>do it? Because he happened to know
            what she had unostentatiously been doing all
            her life; but there are many things that he will
            never know.</p>
         
         <p>He will never know, for instancem that one
            summer when she was supposed to be in Eu&#x2013;
            rope on a holiday, she was secretly comforting
            a remote relative, who in the scramble of a 
            speculative era had landed in the penitentiary.
            He will never know that once, when she wore
            her clothes so many seasons that friends mur&#x2013;
            mured, she was using her allowance for dress
            to shield a woman in disgrace. And I never
            saw a tear of self&#x2013;pity on this worker's face.
            I never heard her utter one complaint against
            life. I never heard her blame others for the
            load bequeathed to her willing shoulders. She
            once told me that the most worrying duty she
            ever undertook was her husband's first fam&#x2013;
            ily of girls brought up in a short of dolce far
            nienteof pampered dreams of what life was 
            to give them, not what they were to give life.</p>
         
         <p>The trouble is,she once burst out, these
            girls have been brought up expecting every&#x2013;
            thing to be done for them. Their indolent sel&#x2013;
            fishness repels the kind of friends they need;
            and when people leave them to themselves, they
            get peevish at life. If they had been taught
            to do something;  <a id="n8" href="#noblesseoblige">*</a>
             if you like,
            that we have to do something for every blessed
            minute we are alive to justify our being alive
            at all they would have learned to forget them&#x2013;
            selves. I am going to put&#x2014;yes, you needn't
            should, I'm going to put&#x2014;in a business of&#x2013;
            fice.
            I did shout. What, business! you, who
            think woman's sphere&#x2014;?
            Shut up,she said. Emerson says only
            fools and cowards are consistent.</p>
         
         <p>So I could go on to tell of hosts of women,
            shaken out by the Panic, that turned every&#x2013;
            thing upside down, from all their little con&#x2013;
            ventional pigeon holes and sheep cotes and
            CHines boots. Indeed, the Panic of '93did
            more than anything else I know, than all the 
            arguments and pros and cons to take the foot
            bindings of prejudice, the Chinese boots of
            tradition, off the feet of Western women.</p>
         
         <p> I couldn't&#x2014; I simply couldn't&#x2014;become a
            parasite,said a Southern woman, who had
            risen to be head of a great brokerage cotton
            agency. Women in industry aren't new. In&#x2013;
            dustrious women have always been in indus&#x2013;
            try. It is merely that of late years, so many
            industries have gone out of the home that we
            have had to sit with empty hands by silent
            looms, or else follow the industries out of the
            home to the place where they have gone.</p>
         
         <p>It does not sound like a wail of woe from
            a Sisterhood of Discontent&#x2014;does it? In fact,
            when the Panic shook us all out of our little
            pigeon holes of prejudice in '93, I do not know
            of a single woman&#x2014;wife, daughter, sister&#x2014;ef&#x2013;
            ficient and self&#x2013;respecting, who did not put her
            shoulder to the wheel, to lift finances out of
            the slough where they had fallen. We did not
            talk of woman's sphere and domestic virutes. 
            We rolled up our sleeves and jumped into the
            arena of work. There were the drum beaters
            of woe, of course, who talked vaguely of for&#x2013;
            mer grandeur and of the fearful come&#x2014;down
            this pioneer rough&#x2014;and&#x2014;tumble had been to
            them; but as they talked, some little slip,
            unmanicured nails, perhaps, the twist of a
            word, the slur of an articulation, the wrong
            tang of slang, a slant of sidewise eyes, put
            the seal of damnation on their revelation; and
            we came to know in that hard stress, when
            every hand was needed to turn, push, pull, oil
            the wheels of life, that <em>only the nogoods pre&#x2013;
               tended to be too good to work.</em></p>
         
         <p>Into this big free hard arena of Western
            work, I came as a child from the East. As we
            none of us get shaken out of our pigeon boxes
            of prejudice, <em>out of the prisons of our own
               personality, which are the deepest dungeons of 
               all,</em> without a flutter of hopes and fears on
            callow wings, I may as well set down the facts.
            They are not pleasant. They were horribly
            painful; and, as I look back, I loathe myself
            for having paid any more attention to the pain
            than a child does to a bump. Of course, if
            you poultice a bump long enough, you can 
            make a perpetual tenderness on the spot&#x2014;
            even an ulcer.</p>
         
         <p>We had not yet moved West.</p>
         
         <p>Always, there had been something in the
            home that made us children want to play out&#x2013;
            side in the sunlight. We would never stay in.
            Winter or summer, we wanted to do all our 
            playing outside. It came to the point where I 
            would let finger tips poking through holes in 
            mits freeze before I wold go in to warm up.
            I didn't want to miss one second of being alive.
            I did not know then that what drove me to the 
            sunlight outside was an intangible, indefinable
            shadow inside. I only new that I was hap&#x2013;
            pier outside; and I carry about with me to this
            day two slightly stubbed finger tips from freez&#x2013;
            ings and thawings, which I would never ac&#x2013;
            knowledge. I knew that each of the brothers
            had left home just as soon as he could obtain
            a position yielding a living. I knew that the
            sisters were kept away at school as long as
            the money could be made to last. Fortunately,
            it did not last down to me; so that I stayed 
            at home long enough to learn what the shadow
            was inside that frove the children outside. </p>
         
         <p>We lived in a very beautiful country border&#x2013;
            ing the lower of one of the Great Lakes. The
            passion for the outdoors made friends for me
            of every horse, cow, dog, cat, chickenand bird
            on the place. If I had not been the youngest,
            I suppose I should have annexed the baby to
            this list, too. I knew more intimately than I
            knew human playfellows, the blue warblers,
            that call flute notes in June, the yellow finches
            that chirp and twitter late in July, the long
            wedge-shaped lines of wild geese that pilfer
            wheat lands in autumn; and I have lain in the
            fields, whistling back their call by the hour. 
            If you lie very still, wild birds are full of curi&#x2013;
            osity, especially crows and geese; and to see
            how near you could bring the ganders honk&#x2013;
            ing down on investigating tours would send the
            most delicious thrills of adventure up and
            down a child's spine. How I escaped accident
            in the stables, I don't know; for neither my
            parents nor the hired hands could keep me out
            of the danger zome. I took extemporized rides
            on broad backed Durham cows that hooked.
            I never went round a horse's heels when un&#x2013;
            watched. I dodged through under their bodies
            and was never kicked. A showy pet carriage
            horse once lifted me with his teeth; but a thick
            coat protected the shoulder bone; and once a
            young heaby draught Clydesdale gave my par&#x2013;
            ents the scare of their lives. I had gone to a
            back field to summon the hired man. The good
            natured fellow put me on the colt's back. I 
            was curious to know whether so heavy a draft
            horse could gallop. The young man was en&#x2013;
            gaged shutting the railroad gate that led up
            the lane. I gave that horse a kick in the soft
            of the flank, where the gentlest horse on earth
            will suffer no liberties; and I don't think he
            stopped demonstrating his kicking abilities at
            both ends for the length of a mile. He had the 
            time of his life for ten full minutes</p>
         
         <p>Hang on, don't let go,came a terrified
            yell behind. The young fellow was afraid to 
            pursie for fear of sending the obstreperous 
            colt over the fence.</p>
         
         <p>Well, miss,he admonished confidentially
            later, I guess you learned when you've raised
            the devil that you have ti hang on, or break
            your neck</p>
         
         <p>I had. The lesson proved useful later, when
            we all went through that Western Panic.</p>
         
         <p>The constant companionship with living real
            things gives a child a curious indifference to
            dead things&#x2014;that is, dead ones that should be
            alive; dolls that do nothing but roll beautiful 
            goo eyesand squeak out inane remarks;
            rocking horse toys, that romp round a room
            kicking their heels and back again, never get&#x2013;
            ting anywhere. I had never the slightest in&#x2013;
            terest in make&#x2013;believe toys. If they put them
            in my Christmas stocking, I threw them behind
            the door. Once an uncle fresh from England
            with very pronounced English ideas about
            proper training for girls (he was a bachelor,
            of course)took me in hand with a good scold&#x2013;
            ing about contempt for dolls&#x2014;Little girls
            ought to like dolls; because dolls were little
            girls' babies. I told him I loved babies;
            but dolls were cheats; they couldn't do a thing
            but roll their eyes. He departed in disgust. I
            sat down to ponder. THis stupid wax thing in
            my hand had brought undeserved rebuke.
            Criminals in human life were hanged, whether
            by heels or head I did not know; but I took
            a spool of thread and hanged that stupid wax&#x2014;
            faced idiot by the heels to the door knob. Then,
            I went out to the real things, the pups and
            the kittens and the colts. After that Christ&#x2013;
            mas, no more inane toys fell to my lot. I was
            given full bent with living real things. Poor
            Uncle Jim! He is an old man now, but still 
            advising other people on their morals and
            their manners; but he has made a failure of
            life. It has blinked him with gooeyes all
            the way through&#x2014;wax&#x2013;faced cheates that melt
            in heat, and break in stress, not realities with 
            whom, if you raise the devil, you have to 
            hang on or break your neck.</p>
         
         <p>That love of realities bred by God's gift of
            staunch animal freinds has stuck through life;
            sometime, a horribly uncomfortable thing,
            like a burr in my chest; then again, a pilor
            star to a promised land. In after like when
            meeting doll&#x2013;types; wax&#x2013;faced, soft&#x2013;haired,
            eyes limpid as sky&#x2013;water, with display of all
            the little doll graces, tinkling ear&#x2013;rings, a show
            of pearly teeth, a roll of expressionless eyes,
            inane remarks, the old feeling of affront would
            come back; and I have never seen what is
            known as the doll type of man without recalling
            these rocking horse toys that couldn't do any&#x2013;
            thinkg but just romp round and back again. Is
            this, too, typical of the changed attitude in
            woman's outlook on life, of her reaching out
            past make&#x2013;believes to realities? Is she going
            to break out of her doll house?</p>
         
         <p>There were rare good days spent in the 
            open meadows with the whole dumb world for
            playfellows. Sundays in good weather were
            spent under a big willow in an old garden lis&#x2013;
            tening to story books. When the autumn and
            spring rains came, we became discoverers of
            unknown worlds rafting uncharted seas on voy&#x2013;
            ages across swollen brooks and mud puddles.
            There were no  merry&#x2013;go&#x2013;roundsor shoot
            the chutes; but we did attempt running Ni&#x2013;
            agara by sliding down a water spout during a
            plunging shower straight into the rain barrel.
            Outsiders and grown&#x2013;ups were not invited to
            this function. THe exigencies of the case re&#x2013;
            quired exit by a low roof window and night&#x2013;
            ies tied à la Turkish<a id="n9" href="#%C3%A0 la Turkish">*</a> 
            costume. The acrobat able to endure longest under the deluge of the
            spout was awarded highest applause. THere
            were sugarings off in the maple woods in
            spring, when taffy on bass wood chips and taf&#x201d;;
            fy in belts of elastic syrup hardening to the
            frost got inextricably tangled in pig tail hair
            and red&#x335;;riding&#x335;;hoods. These celebrations were
            usually held by starlight round a huge log fire.
            That out&#x2013;door world afforded little feet a 
            chance to chase real adventure and real ro&#x2013;
            mance down the real paths of everyday life;
            and I never see the feet of youth on the age&#x2013;
            less quest of ramnce along city streets, but I
            know that if we children had been norn in the
            gutter and those children of the city streets
            had been born to our open meadows&#x2014;we, too,
            would have mistaken painted wax faces and 
            make&#x2013;believe hobby horses for the real thing,
            and come to age cheated of youth.</p>
         
         <p>There comes a time when we know that we
            have suddenly awakened to a realization of
            life. The awakening may come in a great joy,
            or a great love, or a great sorrow, or all three;
            so that we hardly know whether the pain of
            love is greater than its joy, or the joy greater
            than its pain; but when for a moment the veil
            of things lifts, we fall on our faces before
            Life.</p>
         
         <p>I had known that the others of the family
            as they came to their early teens, scattered
            from the home nest. I had come to know that
            the shadow in the home was deepening; but
            what it was, childhood could not define. The
            English uncle had gone West. Our father had
            gone West. The whole country from Atlan&#x2013;
            tic to Pacific of '93. Everybody was hard up.
            Financial worry had come to be a constant in&#x2013;
            visible presence in the home; but it was not
            that.</p>
         
         <p>The revelation came one beautiful spring
            day, when the mist was on the meadows and
            among the cobwebby tender green of the May
            foliage. It was SUnday. WHen we had all
            been polished and furbished up to go off to
            some church festival instead of passing the 
            afternoon under the willow tree, I had a feeling
            that we were being packed off for some reason.
            Our father had come back to make arrange&#x2013;
            ments to move us West; and somehow there
            was something in the air. I couldn't help sus&#x2013;
            pecting that both my mother and father were
            mentally distressed. I ran round to the back
            of the house and came unheard on my mother
            standing very still by a rain pool in the or&#x2013;
            chard. SHe did not see me in time to hide the 
            secret revelaed on her face. I had caught 
            the expression on the face reflected in the pool be&#x2013;
            for she looked up. It was despair of life; the
            utter end of hope; heartbreak mute for a life
            time. She did not speak. Neither did I. I
            was not ten years old; and childhood fell away
            like a worn cloak from that day.</p>
         
         <p>I knew; and yet I could not have told what 
            I knew. I knew from that day that I must
            earn. I knew from that day that I must fight,
            that <em>there is no peace without a victory,</em> that
            he who fights and runs away and lives to
            fight another day,might just as well <em>fight
               the fight at the first challenge of fate,</em> and win
            or die trying to win; for <em>if he runs away,there
               is no hiding place in Heaven or Hell&#x2014;defeat
               will pursue him.</em>Sooner or later he must turn
            and make his stand, and do or die. It isn't
            as we would have it. IT is as lie ordains. I 
            knew that Phantom Fright and Want and that
            tragedy of all tragedies&#x2014;a living one, a hope&#x2013;
            less chasm between husband and wife&#x2014;had
            come menacing our happiness like satyr ghosts
            stealing out of the dark. I knew from that day
            that I must protect the home; or see it de&#x2013;
            stroyed; and is not that typical of ninety-nine
            cases out of a hundred, where girls and women
            become wage&#x2013;earners, where they enter the
            arena called industry?</p>
         
         <p><em>It is not a matter of choice. Therefore cease
               arguing about it. It is a matter of force.
               Therefore, let us see that the conditions are
               made right</em>&#x2014;that the girl is as well protected
            outside the home as in it, and that she goes
            forth equipped with the only weapon that will 
            win the Battle of Life&#x2014;efficiency, physical and 
            mental. It did not matter in the least whether
            I was able to earn, able to fight, able to pro&#x2013;
            tect. I had to, whether I was able or not. If
            I was not able, then I must make myself able.</p>
         
         <p>I did not realize then that every member of
            our family had not been born with several very
            serious handicaps; too many nerves, too little
            nerve; more brains than brawn, which fore&#x2013;
            ordains tradegy just as soon as the hard test 
            of life's scramble up and down hill begins to
            shake the flimsy machinery to pieces; and a
            very pronounced tendency to weak lungs on
            both sides of the house. Against thes handi&#x2013;
            caps should be set three distinct advantages.
            First, we all had the advantage of that out&#x2013;
            door life, of training in realities, that never lie
            and never cheat. Fools we have been all of 
            us, many times. Blunders we have made ga&#x2013;
            lore, so that I have come to the pass where,
            though I ask God to forgive my sins because I 
            can't forgive them myself, ten times more I 
            ask Him to wipe out my blunders; for I
            wouldn't forgive them if I could. And I think
            we've all been inclined slightly to be soft
            heads. We have had had to learn to be hard, to
            realize that though diamond and charcould are
            composed of the very same thinkg, it is the dia&#x2013;
            mond that is hard. Training in out&#x2013;door re&#x2013;
            alities taught us all truth and integrity. I
            mean the kind of truth so that you realize that
            you must not lie to yourself. Another advan&#x2013;
            tage was my mother's belief that innocence is 
            no protection unless it is the innocence of
            knowledge as distinguished from the innocence
            of ignorance. She did not believe that a boy 
            could know what evils to shun or why, a girl
            what dangers or why, unless taught what the 
            signs of the evils and dangers were, instead od
            learning by experience, when it is too late.
            We all stepped into the arena of life knowing
            the signs to shun and why.</p>
         
         <p>There was another advantage very hard to
            define but we all went out in the world 
            equipped with it. My mother had a peculiar,
            almost uncanny, Cletic clairvoyant power to
            project the image of her personality with us
            all through life. In stress, in turmoil, in joy,
            in tight places of complicated decision, we have
            all felt her invisibly behind us, not advising,
            but shedding a sort of spiritualist and know little
            about spiritualism; but I knoew that we have
            all had this consciousness of her influence. It
            has a peculiarly clarifying, calming effect,
            when the waters flow below the bridge of life
            both turbid and tempestuous&#x2014;this spirit
            touch of a love that is&#x2014;I cannot say dead; for I
            know that the presence is with me as really 
            and tensely to&#x2013;day as that afternoon when we
            stood beside the rain pool in the orchard.</p>
         
         <p>I longed to grow up. I grudged the min&#x2013;
            utes till I could earn. If I could have taken 
            a dagger and stabbed these Phantom FOes
            menacing out of the dark, I would gladly have
            died for the privilege of giving the death 
            stroke; but the trouble is <em>seeing red and going
               out to kill&#x2014;doesn't help. It's hustling that
               helps.</em></p>
         
         <p>My mother did not speak. Neither did I as 
            we linked arms and went up the back stairs.
            At the landing she turned.</p>
         
         <p>Aren't you going to the festival?</p>
         
         <p>I should my head. We entered the room; and
            I flung my arms about her, but could not utter
            the question on my lips, any more than she
            could muster up evasive words to delude child&#x2013;
            hood back into blind happiness. I laid my head
            on her shoulder. There were no tears. Though
            tears have come to my eyes and throat since,
            from that day to this, I have literally never
            shed a tear. What I wanted to ask, what I 
            wanted to hurl at the very throne of God, was
            the question&#x2014;Is it common lot of woman
            to suffer in mute heartbreak? Is suffering
            an inevitable and necessay part of her lot?
            Does it do any good, this suffering? What's
            it for? why? I have been seeing the an&#x2013;
            swers to those questions all my life, <em>answers
               in face, not argument;</em>and I should like to bo&#x2013;
            row the angel Gabirel's trumpet to sound
            abroad the answer that I've found. It would
            needs be a golden instrument with the mellow
            notes of ahunter's horn or the glad shout of
            disimprisoned waters in spring to voice the
            answers I have found.</p>
         
         <p>And isn't that typical too, of this whole
            woman movement? Aren't the women moving
            uncertainly on untired feet to untried goals&#x2014;
            seekers? And aren't the wailers, the para&#x2013;
            sites, the sisterhoods of discontent weak ones             
            lost in the dark, shivering at Phantom Fears
            they will neither fight nor face&gt; That was my
            first glimmering of the great economic fact,
            which the world has barely yet sighted that
            women in industry, te economic independence
            of women, if you like to put it that way is not
            the repudiation of womanhood and the func&#x2013;
            tions of womanhood, but is the building of a
            fortress of security round about womanhood
            against brutality and force and hunger; is a
            guarantee of the right of eveyr man child and
            every woman child to be love&#x335;;born.</p>
         
         <p>And in a few weeks we had joined the great 
            migration West.</p>
