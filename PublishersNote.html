Foreword
<h1> Foreword</h1>
<p>It need hardly be stated here&#x2014; these are the random thoughts of a busy woman ,
and of a woman who is happy because she works. Woman in industry is no new
phenomenon in the world . Women have been in industry since time began , since &#x201c;
Adam delved and Eve span .&#x201d; Only in modern days industry has gone out of the
home; and woman has followed it out. Industrious women have been in industry
from creation. It is no new problem . It is an old problem projected out into
the complexities of a fearfully complicated modern world .</p>
<p>Nor are these thoughts a series of fairy stories, of theories as to how things
ought to be. They are narratives of fact, as to how things are, disguised so
slightly as not to disguise in the least, the thread of absolute truth . For
disguises there are. Each chapter is a record of a segment from a life. These
records could not have been given except on condition that the persons should
remain anonymous.</p>
<p>The whole series sprang from a chance remark in an editorial office one day. The
world ir was talking about a wail of woe purporting to come from a woman who
worked. It didn't ring true. The woman set out to pity herself ; and she
succeeded admirably ; but the serio comic thing is &#x2014; the workers don't wail. I
work ; and love it. All the women I know , who are worth knowing, work in the
home, or out of it, and glory in work . I say this irrespective of the fact,
whether they own a mill, or a million. The happy women are the women who work ;
the unhappy ones, those who are idle . I turned and asked the editor why we were
voicing the wail of woe, when all the women he knew , who were worth while , and
all the women I knew , who were worth while were workers. Why didn't we sound
the note of joy for those who sing over their looms?</p>
<p>And so the thoughts came forth random -wise - snatched from the days of a busy
woman - in no sense a story, in no sense a plot, simply segments of human life,
hints of things rather than things themselves, an interpretation of woman in the
great modern economic world .</p>
<p>The eighteenth century was the century of discovery and exploration. The
nineteenth century was the century of exploitation and invention . Are we
entering on a century when we shall discover, explore and map another world &#x2014;
the world of spirit powers ? What part is woman going to play in this new world
? Is it to prepare her for this part that the impetus has come, forcing her into
new arenas, of which even our mothers did not dream ? I don 't know . I only
know the push has come, shoving us out. Where are we going I don't know . I only
know if the day's work be well done we shall arrive at that best of all promised
lands&#x2014; the Land of Satisfied Souls. These thoughts are not written for married
women ; and they are not written for single women ; and they are not written for
women in the home; and they are not written for women out of the home. They are
written for women who know ; whether they are scrubbing departmental store
stairs, crooning over babies, clipping off dividend coupons, or cheering the
despairing heart of some lover in the struggle. Noisy disputations, the pros
and cons of feminists and anti feminists &#x2014; have no place here. Why should they ?
Like the feline night-prowlers, they express nothing but their own antagonisms.
Let us watch rather for the white sun -lit spaces of the dewy dawn, when one
must listen for the voices of the Morning and brood over what their music means
as Mary brooded over her Unborn .</p>
