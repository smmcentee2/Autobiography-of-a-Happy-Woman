         <h1> The Sisterhood of Service </h1>
         
         <p> By the time I had turned over books and keys and put things to rights in the
            office of the financial promoter, it was twelve o'clock. </p>
         
         <p> The office building was situated just where four great thoroughfares converged
            into a main street, like Broadway, New York, at 42nd Street; or Yessler Way,
            Seattle. <a id="n1" href="#Yesler"> *
               </a> Workers were pouring out for
            the noon hour from the leather and cigar factories across the bridge, from the
            big departmental stores, and from the insurance buildings. There were literally
            myriads of young girls. I had never noticed them so closely before that day,
            when for the first time I felt myself a part of the great army of the new
            economic era, when for the first time I felt the solidarity and cohesiveness of
            this great World of Work. </p>
         
         <p> I watched the throngs pouring out for the noon hour. I do not need to tell you,
            do I, that the women and girls in the offices wore airs of grand duchesses of
            the Vere de Vere type <a id="n2" href="#Vere"> *
               </a>to the women and
            girls of the departmental stores; and that the women and girls of the
            departmental stores wore the grand duchess air to the women and girls from the
            factories; and I suppose the women and girls of the factories would a try the
            same airs on the scrubbies <a id="n3" href="#Scrubbies"> *
               </a> of the
            basement, snobs all the way down the scale, trampling one another's chances. Yet
            all were fellow workers in the great new economic army of the World of Work.
            What menaced one menaced all. Laws defective for one were defective for all.
            Lack of protection that might injure one might likewise injure each, or any, or
            all of that army of workers. Men had their lodges, their fraternities, their
            labor unions, to help in time of stress; but this army of women workers, more
            easily menaced because they were women, what had they? They had not even a
            standard of physical fitness; of personal defense; of value in the eyes of the
            law as an economic asset to the nation. These were the mothers of the coming
            race; yet the law would punish the maiming of a cow with fourteen years'
            imprisonment; the maiming of a woman or girl with two years; the theft of a colt
            with five years' imprisonment; the theft of a little girl worker, abduction, I
            believe, is the ugly word describing it, with two years' imprisonment. </p>
         
         <p> Of the 450,000 people, more or less, who will have to pay an income tax in the
            United States, it is estimated that less than 40,000 are women. Of the
            wage&#x2013;earners in the United States, seven millions are women. Standing on
            the street corner, watching the army of women workers, it did not require
            prophetic foresight to gauge the revolution in values bound to come when this
            army of women workers wakens to a consciousness of its own solidarity and
            cohesiveness, wakens to that freemasonry of comradeship that exists among all
            classes of men, without any confusion of coal scuttles with silver spoons. </p>
         
         <p> There and then I took my resolution. As between this little coterie of women
            whom the world called <q> favored, protected, </q> and this great
            army whom the world called <q> workers, </q> unprotected themselves,
            but protecting others, I took my stand with the workers. </p>
         
         <p> Why? </p>
         
         <p> They stood for plus. </p>
         
         <p> They represented a marching army, progress forward, not that stationary
            excellence for which reactionaries fight and which to me means atrophy to the
            powers of the soul. </p>
         
         <p> They needed help, and, more than help, they needed the comprehension, not of
            charity, but of independent, self&#x2013;respecting comradeship. </p>
         
         <p> Then, if the Christ&#x2013;creed was to be anything more than an anodyne for an
            uneasy conscience, what ranks offered better scope for the helpfulness and
            service of that creed than this army of women workers? </p>
         
         <p> Also, there was another reason. It came faltiringly then. It comes falteringly
            today. The modern world has literally been robbing the home of woman's vocations
            for fifty years. Nursing, teaching, mending, weaving, butter­ making, plain
            house-keeping&#x2014;have been supplanted by the hospital with the professional
            nurse, the school with the professional teacher, factory clothing, factory
            weaving, factory food, the departmental store, the apartment house. If the
            process of robbing the home of woman's vocations continues with the accelerated
            progress of the last fifty years, will the day not come when the unoccupied
            woman, the rich woman, the woman who has not married, or whose children have
            grown and gone out of the home; when the girl who wants an occupation and is
            past the teens when fripperies fill an occupation, will the day not come when
            this smaller coterie of women will ask permission to come down and out of their
            idleness into this army of service? Isn't this practically the meaning of <q>the get-together </q> clubs in every city in the United
            States, where the women who work and the women who don't meet for mutual
            helpfulness? Isn't it the meaning of the terrible divorce court tragedies of the
            idle hands? Lady Bountiful, passing out largess with kid gloves and a forty-rod
            pole, is not needed as ensign-carrier in this army. Charity is always cheaper
            than justice. What is needed is not charity. What is needed is a new <em> noblesse oblige; </em>
            <a id="n4" href="#Noblesse"> *
               </a> to teach the toilers to sing songs
            of joy again over their looms; a Sisterhood, not of Discontent, but of Service,
            in which the weakest and the poorest and the meanest will be girt with the
            defence of the strongest in time of stress and danger. Will women work this
            problem out, as men have worked it out in their fraternities? </p>
         
         <p> It sounds easy, this resolution; but it wasn&#x2019;t. Of a very large connection on
            both sides of the house, we were the only family where a woman ever became a
            wage-earner. It was bad enough to be obliged to do it; but to glory in it! I can
            hear some of the spurious wails yet. One good relative, I recall, warned me it
            would totally ruin my manners for society. Another good dame, who was not
            related and had just come West in time to receive a tail-end blow from the Panic
            <a id="n5" href="#thePanic"> *
               </a>, used to sit bewailing by the
            hour that her "dear girls should ever need to work." She had set her face like
            flint against that need, telling her daughters it was the duty of <q>father and brothers to take the blasts of the world,"</q> till
            the father took so many blasts that he ran away to New York with an adventuress;
            and one son carried the load till he used government funds of which he was
            custodian, so that his mother had to mortgage her home to keep him out of the
            penitentiary; and a second son ran away from home to escape an impossible
            burden. When the third son married and left the sisters in the lurch, they
            turned out and wished they had met the challenge of fate half way before. </p>
         
         <p> Another woman, I recall, who had been a somewhat famous opera singer in her day
            and married a financial broker in our city, perhaps more decent than Mr. Blank
            but also more flamboyant, was so determined that the world should not know they
            had been hit by the panic that she moved her entire establishment over to the
            new palatial hotel which the railroad had built, and there entertained
            elaborately and dressed as of old in Paris imported gowns, and set her face like
            flint against the new order. Perhaps, it was her way of helping her broker
            husband not to lose his customers. Perhaps, it was her way of working, though
            she declaimed that under no circumstances should a woman ever become a
            wage-earner; but no one was bluffed but the bluffer. We all knew that the hotel
            carried their account for $10,000 that year, in return for her husband's
            influence as a lobbyist in railroad matters; and the strain of pretending she
            had what she hadn't sent her to a Paris nerve specialist at the end of a year,
            where only the agility of a nurse prevented suicide during nervous depression.
            Personally, I think that woman worked a great deal harder for her living than
            those of us who openly joined the army of wage-earners. </p>
         
         <p> I remember telling a very dear woman relative my resolution to fight <em>for </em> the army of wage-earners as well as <em> with </em> them and of the dangers that must menace many a
            lonely girl worker who had no strong circle of loyal friends to gird her round
            with companion-ship and safety. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Why do girls go into employments where there are such dangerous
               associates?</q> she demanded indignantly. <q>No girl ought to
               be exposed to such dangers. No girl ought to leave her home, if there are
               such dangers outside it.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> My answer I wrote in one of those little autograph albums which were the rage at
            the time. At the top of the page I penned her words-Girls Ought not to Go into
            Employments Where There are Dangers? Below I wrote one of the rhymes, that now
            hummed through my head of nights in place of old Solomon's epigrams: </p>
         
         <p>
            
            <br>
               <br>
                  
                  <l>Good maxima, these, for those who need them not! </l>
                  
                  <l>If hounds be hard on heel of deer, then what? </l>
                  
                  <l>When spurs dig deep in bleeding sides, the horse grows hot.</l>
                  </br>
               
               <br>
                  
                  <l>The deer pursued ne'er halts at brink of bank,</l>
                  
                  <l>The horse hard-pressed can't choose to stay in rank, </l>
                  
                  <l>Tho' wall too high or ditch too broad may break a shank. </l>
                  </br>
               </br>
            
            </p>
         
         <p> Having been entrenched with the triple protection of father, husband, brother, I
            know she had not the faintest idea what I meant. </p>
         
         <p> I did not get off the car opposite my home. I rode to the end of the car track
            and walked out on the prairie, where the purple wind flowers were just breaking
            through the snow. I wanted to walk in the tossing rough spring wind and to think
            in the clean open spaces. </p>
         
         <p> What reason had I to give for resigning a twelve-hundred a year job in time of
            such financial stress? I had been bound to the wheel, and had at one stroke cut
            the bonds. You can't explain that Astarte <a id="n6" href="#Astarte"> *
               </a> and Moloch <a id="n7" href="#Moloch"> *
               </a> may have
            reincarnations in our modern system dangerous to youth as the old circle of fire
            and drugged wines. Some future historian will narrate that of our day. We,
            ourselves, refuse to take cognizance of it. No man, or woman, has battled out
            the contest of life without meeting the same challenge. It is the eternal
            challenge. Our temptation to barter what we know is right for the crust of bread
            called a living always comes, when we are in the wilderness spent of body and
            soul; when we feel that those we love are dependent on the selling of our souls. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Do the fool-thing and expect God to perform a miracle to save
               you! Jump over the precipice of right and wrong; then expect Heaven to save
               a smash; as you, perhaps, have saved others!</q> Heaven doesn't! There is no
            fence of miracles round Life's precipice, though we break our necks to save
            those we love! Don't think you'11 meet the challenge only once! You'll meet it
            every day you are in the game of life; not as downright and honest spoken as
            Satan in the wilderness. That's why I like the clean-cut way Christ sent Satan
            about his business! Most of us haven't that sense! </p>
         
         <p> When I reached home two or three friends had come in for afternoon tea. An
            animated discussion was going on about somebody who had lost a position in civil
            service through the hard times. <q>You don't think there would be
               any chance in your office ?</q> someone asked. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>There might be,</q> I answered. <q>I have just
               resigned.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> If I had thrown a bomb into that little group, I couldn't have caused greater
            consternation. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Well, </q> gasped one auditor, who belonged to that category of
            women whom George Adam Smith <a id="n8" href="#Smith"> *
               </a> has
            described as the cow that tramples more corn than it can
            ever eat. 
             "Whom the gods wish to destroy they first make
            mad.''
            </p>
         
         <p> Only two people did not agree with her; my mother, who did not speak at all, and
            that daughter of a friend to whom I have already referred &#x2014; the girl with
            <q>I won't,</q> born on her very lips. </p>
         
         <p> It is sometimes a good thing to have the spirit to challenge life before it
            challenges you. This youngster had jumped into the discussion with her sleeves
            rolled up before I had a chance to offer any explanation. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>You did perfectly right,</q> she burst out. <q>I
               wouldn't stick in an old office in your state of health. What's a salary if
               you give your life for it? Industry be diddled,</q> she asseverated with a
            stamp. <q>I guess the life of one single soul is of more value
               than all industry, if Christ wasn't a big liar! I guess there is something
               more in life than plugging for a living! I want to live: not merely exist!
               Any girl is a fool who drudges along without a try at bettering her
               position&#x2014;I don't care what it is. As to sacrificing herself! Bah!
               Sheep and the shambles! I hate sheep types! If I were in that kind of trap,
               I'd jump out if I had to break my neck &#x2014;</q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>You might break your neck,</q> wailed the woman who had thought
            it criminal of anyone under any circumstances to resign a gainful occupation in
            such hard times. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Then, I'd sooner break my neck and have one breath of real life
               than live a life of perpetual imprisonment; and I 'II bet Christ would back
               me if He were here today, </q> vowed this prenatal rebel. </p>
         
         <p> As we all knew she lived up to her creed of defying life's challenges, a laugh
            greeted this sally. </p>
         
         <p> She waited till the others had left. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>I bet a hill of beans, you couldn't stand that old shin plaster
               another minute, she at once exploded. Her whole life was an explosion of
               temper and laughter and tears and storms and actions. I used to wonder if
               she were still when she slept.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q> Mr. Blank is one of the kindest&#x2014; </q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q> Waugh,</q> she interrupted in Sioux lingo;<q>
               but he yappies too much. He's kind first, last and altogether for what he
               gets in return for himself; and you know it; and don't you lie about it!
               What are you going to do!</q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Hike for the higher altitudes, I guess, where the ozone is
               champagne.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> She bounced almost out of her boots. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>You are to come back to the ranch with me.</q> She was living
            on a ranch at the foothills of the Rockies. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>I declare if I have to go back there alone, I'm going to
               cultivate conversation with jack rabbits and coyotes.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> I tried to stem her torrent and explain that when medical debts and lame ducks
            and home had been cared for there would be less than $50 left, and that a
            semi-invalid would be a nuisance and a burden in a home where the only help
            obtainable consisted of disreputable old squaws; but she swept my objections
            aside in a torrent. Fifty dollars was loads and bushels and stacks of money. She
            almost insinu­ ated that if we had more, we wouldn't know what to do with it. We
            could use the ranch horses and rent an extra saddle for the summer at $5; she
            thought it probable that she could borrow an extra saddle. Her brother was in
            the railroad offices. It seemed the business of the ranch was to sell beef
            cattle to the dining car department; and she would go and see the divisional
            superintendent and obtain a pass that very week. She was as good as her word.
            She left for the mountains the next day; and posted a pass back to me inside a
            month. </p>
         
         <p> Now, the question I ask myself is this-sup­ posing I had not bad a pre-natal
            rebel for a friend; would I not also have passed to the immeasurable human scrap
            heap? Supposing when I closed that other door to wrong oppor­ tunity ("winnow not with
            every wind" said the prophet) that her indomitable spirit had not
            unlatched the other door as you and I and all of us of the Sisterhood of Service
            can un­ latch without cost or effort to ourselves, doors of opportunity to the
            cul-de-sac of other lives, would I not have perished in the trap, or died bound
            to the wheel, as thousands, tens of thou­ sands of lives perish every year for
            want of a little dauntless thoughtfulness? </p>
         
         <p>
            <em> I had set out in life wanting passionately to know if
               suffering were necessary, challenging the pious blasphemy that it was God's
               will women should suffer ill; and I had come far enough along the road to
               know that the most of misery is unnecessary, entirely human and hand-made,
               quite as much of it resulting from fumble fingers and thick brains as from
               deviltries; and the most of it from sheer dense egoistical, stupidity.

            <em>I had learned that you can't break law; it breaks you; but
               I had to go a pace farther along the road before I found the way out that <q>nature ever faithful is to such as trust her
                  faithfulness</q>; that, if you kick against law, you'll only bark your
               shins; but that if you harness law and steer with it, not against it, there

         <p> It all cost some horribly acute growing pains of the soul. Don't grin in a
            superior fashion! Those who have not had growing pains may still have their
            growing to do; and wisdom teeth come hardest when they come latest. It was the
            change from a fetish faith to a faith in a Larger God that gave me my worst
            growing pains at this period. Sometimes, out in the mountains, flat on my back
            in the sun, while the horse grazed at the end of a tethering rope, this sort of
            thing would come to me faster than I could write it in a book I usually carried
            in the saddle bag and read at noon: </p>

                  <l>I shall say to this mountainous thing in my way, </l>
                  
                  <l>'Be removed to the depths of the sea'; and with speed</l>

         <p> The night I resigned, when I sat down to read to my mother (we had neither of us
            men­ tioned the fact of my resignation), I opened George Adam Smith's poetic
            interpretation of <em>Isaiah</em> as the epic poem of a race
            adjured by the passionate and inspired singer to come back from the whoring
            after false ideals, please note that word <em>whoring,</em> and
            grow to the stature of its national destiny. (Of course, we do not need such
            passionate, inspired singers to-day for a money-mad age whirling dervish dances
            round the umbilical cord of its own ego.) </p>
         
         <p> The first words I read were, In returning and rest shall
            be your confidence. I turned a few pages, where Smith has rendered
            the original in English blank verse. For the bed is
            shorter than that a man can stretch himself on; the covering narrower than
            he can wrap himself in.
            </p>
         
         <p> My mother had the most calming presence I have ever known in a human being. She
            was sitting with her long slim white hands folded in her lap. The red of the
            lamp shade seemed to accentuate the chiseled white profile in the half dark of
            the room. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>I am glad you resigned,</q> she said. <q> I felt
               all along that the time would come when you would. It has served its
               purpose. </q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>And when one door closes behind?</q> I asked. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q> When the half gods go, the true gods come,</q> she answered
            with that faith of the little child, which cannot doubt. <q> Read
               those lines of George Adam Smith  again. </q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>They are not Professor Smith's. They are the prophet's: In
               returning and rest shall be your confidence: For the bed is shorter than
               that a man can stretch himself on; the covering narrower than he can wrap
               himself in. </q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>I wonder if that is why we go askew!</q> she asked. <q>I wonder if God's plans are so much bigger than our creeds
               that like new wine they burst the old bottles?</q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q> What do you think the first means?</q> I asked her. </p>
         
         <p> She sat perfectly still without answering for a moment; then smiled as quietly
            as if my little world of faith had not smashed down; as if, indeed, the panic
            had not torn the little world of the whole half million population of the state
            at that time up by the roots like a plowshare driven through an ant hill. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Read it again,</q> she said. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>
               In returning and rest shall be your
               confi&#x2013;dence! </q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>It means,</q> she said, <q>"what you are going to
               do when you go to the mountains and cast yourself in confidence and peace on
               the eternal laws of God."</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> And that is exactly what happened. I can no more describe the process of healing
            in body and soul than you can describe the process of rebirth when a night rain
            falls on parched ground and all the slumbering seedlings come through with green
            hands that clap in gladness to wind and sun. A wise old canoeman once said to
            me: <q>Never fight rapids, paddle like hell till you catch the
               current that will swerve you away from the rocks, then lie back and let her
               go and take your ease!</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> It is utterly the same with life. Work like the furies incarnate, if you like,
            till you learn what the law is, what the trend of it is! Catch that, and it will
            carry you past all rocks, perhaps not to the haven of your desire, but to the
            destiny to which the current of the law carries, whither you have to go
            willy-nilly; and whether you arrive whole or smashed depends on whether you go
            with the current of God's law or against it! </p>
         
         <p> My friend was a tonic. She fought and jounced my convictions at every turn as I
            fought hers, which is infinitely better than the softening sympathy that turns
            pity in on self. If you died with her, you would have to die in your boots and
            on the run; for she kept you out morning, noon and night. So much of our misery
            comes from the corrosion of acid discontent in the repose of our better natures
            that this activity, giving no time for morbid thought, went far toward healing.
            I defy you to sit on a spirited horse with a morbid liver or a peeved
            self-pitying soul! You have to take hold of yourself; or you will break your
            neck. </p>
         
         <p> Also, it was a stage in the West's development that can never again be repeated
            in American history. Frontier was giving way to pioneer. Ranch lands, where one
            cow had had roaming ground over a thousand acres were being carved up into the
            settlers' quarter sections. The newspapers were still disputing as to whether
            farmers could grow wheat in the dry inter-mountain empire. The first
            transcontinental to cross the Divide in this part of the Rockies had just been
            completed; and the hordes of Chinese and Italian navvies had scattered to the
            lumber mills and mines of the mountains. I remember after turbid spring floods
            and summer thaw bringing down the snow of the upper peaks, at the period when
            the tin-horn gambling hells and saloon dance halls were running full blast, of a
            Monday morning after a Sunday celebration, as many as ten dead <q> Chinks</q> would be washed up on the sand bars in the
            river. Sometimes the dead man washed up would be white. Even then, few inquiries
            were made. If you didn't want to go over the precipice, keep away from the edge;
            for there was no mistaking the red light of danger on that edge! </p>
         
         <p> Yet, with it all, womanhood was safer than in the padded parlors of
            civilization. Why? I asked my friend's brother that question once. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q> Because every man jack in this camp knows that if he as much
               as looked disrespect at a decent woman, he would be cut into scraps in about
               two seconds; and there would be no coroners' inquest, </q> he answered
            savagely. </p>
         
         <p> I had a forcible illustration of this not long after I went out. My friend and
            her brother were going for a Sunday to one of the silver camps up from the
            foothills half way to heaven, as he expressed it. We had set out at daybreak on
            Saturday with the peak where we were going plainly ahead of us, but we lost
            sight of it when we left the foothills and plunged into the heavy hemlock
            forests to cork­ screw up a zig-zag trail barely wide enough for a horse. Fool
            hens, or mountain grouse, flumped up heavily and bobbed and nodded at us from
            logs by the side of the trail. Marmot would come scrabbling up from the rocks
            and whistle shrilly as a school boy. Sometimes you heard a raucous cry overhead,
            and, looking up, you could see through the gray-green Spanish moss, a bald-head
            eagle perched lonely on the topmost tip of a dead branch. Here, a turn in the
            corkscrew trail opened vistas to the upper peaks shining opalescent in a
            cloudless sky. There, you had skirted the sharp elbow of a precipice; and were
            neck deep in fog thick as wool at cloud line. Another pace and turn, you were
            above cloudline in the flawless sunshine again. Wherever a coulee cut and
            trenched down the mountain slope, there you would see the rough prospectors with
            their sacks of tools following the <q>float,</q> or signs of metal,
            up the stream bed to the head veins. In this way, the most wonderful galena <a id="n9" href="#Galena"> *
               </a> veins of that country had been found.
            Washed or unwashed, shaven or rough with weeks in the wilds, at sight of a
            woman, the roughest man's hat would come off. Even the Chinks would stand off
            the trail and simper a <q>How-do.</q> It wasn't air we were
            breathing. It was some compound of distilled sunbeams brewed up with about a
            thousand years of oil of healing from the pines. Every switch-back on the trail,
            we would pause and give our horses a breath. I drank and drank great breaths of
            the dew­ washed resinous air. My friend looked over her shoulder and kicked her
            feet free from her stirrups to ease her horse. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Isn't it a scrumptious joy to be alive and kicking?</q> she
            said. </p>
         
         <p> It was such a scrumptious joy I was beginning to wonder in what nightmare prison
            of my own personality I had been chained back there in that other life. Wasn't
            that the trouble in this restless life of pressure in the cities&#x2014;<em>humans were chained up to serve things, instead of the things
               being chained up to serve the humans? </em> Freedom beckoned to us from
            the glad world of the out-doors; and we sat glooming in our own self-created
            despairs till eyes I could not see God for our maudlin tears? </p>
         
         <p> Just where the trail ran into the long single street of a raw, new, unpainted
            mining town, built with the back doors overhanging the brink of a brawling
            mountain brook, a fog came drifting out of the pass followed by a drenching
            rain. My friends were not sure that a drenching rain would be good for me at
            that stage of the game on a two days' trip, and asked if I would mind staying in
            the hotel of the little mining town for the night, while they went on up to the
            silver camp :fifteen miles farther. The brother was to collect the money on some
            beeves shipped in, and the sister did not like him to come down that trail alone
            with so much ready money on his person. I told them to go ahead, by all means.
            It would be fun to see the new camp. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>I would not go out after dark if I were you,</q> called the
            brother, as I took refuge under the hotel veranda. <q> Saturday is
               pay day, you know, all the miners and lumber jacks will be down from the
               hills.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> The hotel had board partitions of one ply, unpainted; and there was not a door
            in the house with a lock. After dinner, I propped a chair back under the door
            knob of my room so that it could not move without wakening me; and I fell into a
            sleep to defy the crack of doom. The grand duchess, who kept the hotel, and I
            were the only two women in a harum&#x2013;scarum population of about two
            thousand; that is, the only two women except some little painted, almond-eyed
            girls across the way in a Japanese dance-<em>hall</em>, I
            believe they called it. It should have been called <em>hell</em>. </p>
         
         <p> I seemed to hear the pour of the rain in my sleep, the roar of the brook, the
            tap-tap of little feet across the way to the strumming of some strange oriental
            string music, when I suddenly came awake to an explosion like a powder blast.
            The rain had ceased. Moon light silvered the room ; and the brook tore behind
            the house less boisterously as of deeper waters; but the roar filled the canyon
            and shook the house. The lumber jacks and miners had come down from the hills ;
            and I do not think there was a faucet or spiggot or bottle or barrel, or saloon
            or gambling joint, that was not doing a wide-open business all that night. The
            houses could not roof a tenth of the population. Men were auctioning whisky in
            tin cups from the tops of kegs in mid-road. They were gambling and dancing and
            sitting and sleeping in every variety of posture in the open street. They
            reminded me of a disturbed ant hill or caterpillar nest. It was a bit
            boisterous; so I did not go down for supper; but sleep was out of the question.
            The barroom was directly under me and I could see what was going on through
            cracks in the floor. </p>
         
         <p> Toward midnight, the drunks were fighting drunk. I thought they had exhausted
            &#x201c;the swears'' of every language under the sun earlier in the evening; but when a
            stiletto drunk Italian and a shillalah<a id="n10" href="#Shillalah"> *
               </a> drunk Irishman began shouting in unexpurgated vernacular on exactly
            which part of each other's anatomy they intended to vent their international
            love, anything I had heard before seemed like a school's first reader compared
            to an unabridged Webster. Just when a yell seemed to forewarn instant murder,
            there was a scuffle-scuffle of feet. Two bodies seemed to be dragged toward the
            railing of the back piazza above the brawling brook. There was a thud, then a
            splash, then tremendous roars of laughter; another thud, another splash, more
            shouts; and the crowds rushed back to the barroom for drinks all round. Good
            fellowship would last till a Polack and Russian, a Jap and Chinaman, would begin
            discussing each other's ancestry in colloquial westernisms. Then, the thud and
            the splash would repeat themselves. This lasted without breathing space till
            five Sunday morning, when the chill of the mountain air drove the rioters back
            up the hills, that is, those of the rioters who could still use their legs.
            Hundreds lay sprawled in the roadway or curled up on saloon steps sound asleep. </p>
         
         <p> A knock came on my door at six, the bar&#x2013;room below was still brawling
            louder than the brook, and the Chinese waiter from the dining room asked me if I
            would please <q>come down and have bleakfast at once; my palty
               from the mines would be down in a few time, and I was to meet them at the
               end of the camp t'wail a mile out.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> I hadn't time to tell him to send breakfast up before he trotted downstairs; and
            I didn't relish passing the open barroom door, whence the smell of rum came
            reeking up stronger than a gin mill and the brawling outsounded the brook.
            Someone must have heard me coming down the stair; for the bar-tender rapped on
            the bar with a glass. <q> Lady's coming, shut up, gents, </q> I
            heard him order, as I dived past the door into the dining-room; and <q>the gents shut up </q> so hard and quick you could have heard a
            pin fall while I was at breakfast. </p>
         
         <p> A cowboy stood at the door with my horse. He helped me to the saddle and told me
            where to find my party waiting a mile down the trail. The road was literally
            littered with unconscious drunks. <q>Set tight to the leather and
               keep a sure stirrup,</q> he advised. <q>Some of them
               booze-busters might scare your broncho!</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> I gave the horse a little kick to put him past the saloon fronts quickly; and he
            shot out so suddenly that away flew my watch. Before I could turn the horse
            round, a dozen men were on their feet to get it. The grizzled fellow who handed
            it to me took off his hat and wished me a pleasant trip. </p>
         
         <p> The incident was typical of the West in its wildest era. A woman was safer than
            in a missionary meeting or a young ladies' semi&#x2013;nary, that is, a woman who
            was not a fool. A woman who was a fool, or careless of the respect due her
            womanhood, could have all the folly on tap in the shortest time possible. At the
            very period when the mountains were infested with discarded gangs of navvies
            <a id="n11" href="#Navvies"> *
               </a> and roving prospectors women
            had begun taking up homesteads. You came on their tiny log cabins in the big
            timber country; or their ten by ten shacks anchored to the prairie by posts at
            each end, as you rode down from the foothills. </p>
         
         <p> One trail my friend and I used to follow passed half a dozen shanties of girl
            homesteaders in a ride of forty miles. The thing that struck me was how many of
            these girls were foreign-born, naturalized citizens </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Why do you think that is?</q> I asked. <q>Why
               don't American girls do that sort of thing more? To be bound to the
               industrial wheel isn't much more independent than the old game.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> She reined up her horse and thought a moment. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Oh, convention has such a strangle-hold and we're so
               democratic, </q> she explained, <q>that we spend most of our
               time hanging on with our eyebrows for fear we lose caste.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>You don't,</q> I answered. <q>When your brother
               and the cow-boys were away last winter and the blizzards came up, you rode
               out and rounded up the whole herd.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>But would I have done so if we had lived Down East where
               everybody would have cocked an eye at me? Don't I do what I sweet please out
               here because we are so secure of our position that nothing matters?</q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Then you think that it's the women up at the top and the women
               down at the bottom, not the half-way-ups, that will get rid of that
               strangle-hold for women and form the great Sisterhood of Service?</q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>I don't know what you mean by Sisterhood of Service! I don't
               think women are ever very sisterly to one another! You're always shooting
               some transcendental sky-rocket past my head into clouds; but if you want to
               know what I think of half-way-ups, I think they'll always fool you; they are
               so scared out of their wits they might slip down a peg.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Let's go in and meet some of these homesteaders,</q> I
            suggested. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>All right! We '11 water our horses here! I know this girl, she
               is teaching the district school, while she puts in her homestead duties.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> We dismounted opposite a gate formed of two posts looped with strands of wire. A
            robust woman of twenty-four, or thereabouts, tanned and weathered by wind and
            sun, came to the shanty door. Life had been cut free from all strangle-hold of
            the artificial here. Shanty and equipment could not have cost more than $50. A
            biscuit box had been extemporized into a book shelf, where lay two or three
            magazines, a Balzac and a Bible. The bed had been built sailor-berth fashion
            against the wall. Another box set up on four crossed legs formed the table, from
            which we shared her evening meal of bacon and eggs. From the window covered with
            dimity curtains we could see her broncho tethered out on the prairie. A big dog
            lay snapping at the flies in the sun. It seemed, she had begun life as an
            operative in a watch factory in Switzerland. Then, she had taught a tiny hamlet
            school in her native land. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>But the wages were not $25 a month,</q> she explained. <q>I could never get ahead on that. What's the use of a woman
               pretending she is independent, unless she is independent? So I emigrated,
               came steerage; and worked my way out here somehow, and got a position in a
               mission school at $50 a month; but if women are going to be independent,
               they must study out ways of being independent, the way a man does; so I
               thought I might as well be putting in home­ stead duties while I taught, and
               get some sit­ fast spot on earth I could call my own. This is my last year
               of homesteading. Next year, I prove up for title.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Will you sell?</q> I asked. Later on, land in the locality of
            this woman's homestead, sold at $50 an acre. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>But no,</q> she answered. <q>I want an inglenook
               of my own always. I'll bring out my father and mother.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> She told us that except for midsummer, when a friend from the nearest town
            joined her, she lived alone, riding to and from the mission school on her
            broncho. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Of course,</q> she said, <q>on winter nights, the
               coyotes smell the ham cooking and come howling under the window; but my big
               St. Bernard drives them off; and I don't know that there is as much to fear
               from these sort of wolves as from the kind of wolves you meet in town,</q>
            and she laughed. </p>
         
         <p> I suppose she felt our attitude of tacit challenge. Her words recalled those
            dream wolves of my childhood, Anxious Fright and Want, which this form of
            economic independence drove off the heels of pursued womanhood. Her words also
            recalled the dire predictions of the study chair theorists about individualism
            menacing motherhood and the economic independence of woman modifying the
            tendency to marriage, and so leaving the propagation of the species to inferior
            types&#x2014;you have heard the arguments&#x2014; haven't you? If I had put it
            that way, she would not have known at what I was driving; so I came at it
            another way. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Yes,</q> I said, as we helped her to clean up her supper dishes
            before going back to our saddles,<q>but if you had stayed on in
               Switzerland, you would probably have married some neighbor's son, and had
               your own little home and family.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> She almost snorted her disdain, <q>But no,</q> she declared. <q>If I had stayed in Switzerland, we would have been so poor
               that I could not have afforded to have children. I would not have wanted
               children. If I had had them, with the high cost of living, I could not have
               done justly by them, they would have had to join the armies of Germany or
               France.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>And now?</q> laughed my friend. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>And now <em> when </em> I marry,</q> she did
            not say if I marry, <q>I'll have something to do for my children;
               <em>There will be no unwanted child of mine.</em></q>
            </p>
         
         <p> My friend suddenly sobered. You will remember she had been born with <q>I won't</q> on her lips because she had been an unwanted
            child. We both of us rode away thoughtfully. A long line of Indians went filing
            up over the foothills, the men on horseback and many of the women on horseback,
            too; but one aged squaw brought up the rear of the procession afoot with a
            bundle on her back half the size of herself. We both reined in. My friend
            pointed with her whip to the old squaw, who was burden bearer, silhouetted on
            the crest of the hill, and to the girl homesteader&#x2019;s shanty, at the foot of the
            slope. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>The old and the new,</q> she said; <q>"and the
               new is only at the foot of the Great Divide beginning to climb.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> Suddenly, she whirled on me in one of her tempest moods. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Look here,</q> she said. <q>You know my life and
               its handicaps: I know yours: what do you think of this whole business of the
               change in woman's position? It is more than economic. It is really a change
               in the relation of the sexes.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> I answered with a question: <q><em>Do you think
                  the day will ever come when women are not bartered chattels in marriage;
                  when there is no unwanted child; when children will be conceived not in
                  sin but love; and will be born not in travail but in joy? </em></q>
            </p>
         
         <p> She leaned forward with her elbow on the saddle pommel, and her chin in the palm
            of her gauntlet. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>It's coming now,</q> she answered pointing to the girl
            homesteader's shanty; but when we looked up for the aged Indian woman under the
            huge bundle, she had dropped over the crest of the hill. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>When the dawn bursts in perfect day, I want to come back and
               see the new type of human race,''</q> she went on. <q>'' I
               want to see human beings, not born tired from overwrought mothers, and kids
               not born criminals from their parents' blood, and youngsters not born scared
               and squally at life from the time they open their eyes because of the fright
               in the heart of the mother who carried them! Of course, there are always
               confusion and waste and suffering in time of a great transition! Do you
               think that you or I would have got out for ourselves if life hadn't taken us
               by the scruff of the neck and pitched us out to sink or swim? Do you think
               my Aunt Maria would have gone out and rounded up a herd of steers in a
               blizzard?</q> (Her Aunt Maria was a notorious snob.) <q>Of
               course, it hurts in spots; but that only takes the coward and the slug and
               the skulk and the shirk and the pretence out of our woman hearts; so that
               only the fit survive; and I want more than ever to come back and see the new
               type of human race in a hundred years.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> A lantern light twinkled in the girl homesteader's little lone shanty. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Our great grandmothers did that kind of thing,</q> she nodded
            down, <q>two hundred years ago, when this continent was first
               pioneered and settled. It is we, who are the generation of half-way-ups,
               neither fish, flesh, nor good red herring! As we have grown in wealth and
               civilization, instead of working out a new free code of freedom for
               ourselves, we've imitated the social code and standards of an effete old
               world, that is weary of its own life to extinction and is discarding the
               customs we are taking for the very salvation of our souls.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            The bed is shorter than that a man may stretch
            himself on, I quoted. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>And new wine bursts old bottles,</q> she laughed. <q>Let us go home on the lick.</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> And we went over the crest of the foothills in a moonlight I can describe only
            as floods of silver. Just where we swerved into a ravine, some settler had been
            trying out some new drought-resisting variety of wheat, and where we skirted the
            wheat field, a coyote, earth color and couchant and still as stone, leaped
            across our trail and loped off into the wheat. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Chase him! Chase him !</q> she shouted. <q>Don&#x2019;t
               let him go! Let us run him down! Wolves hamstrung ten of our colts last
               winter. Run him down, run him down!</q> and off across that settlers' farm
            we galloped, through wheat heavy headed and high as our saddles,
            fol&#x2013;lowing only by the rise and fall of the wheat to the fore, where the
            skulking thing would run crouching and then take a flying leap in the moonlight.
            He was making for the rough ground of a coteau, where a noisy stream came
            tumbling down from the mountains. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>Head him off,</q> she shouted. <q>You keep the
               field. I '11 take the stream bed,</q> and in she plunged girth-deep; but the
            wolf was too quick for us. He gained the stream and crossed it at a bound. So
            did we; but when he went up over the rocks, we reined in glowing wet and
            panting. </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>What in the world do you think you would have done if you had
               caught it?"</q> I asked. </p>
         
         <p> She leaned forward and unstrapped her saddle pocket. Inside was not a book,
            which I usually carried, but a revolver. (It reminded me of what I had once
            heard a town man say. <q>Brute force! Bah!</q> he said. <q>There has been no ascendancy of brute force since the
               invention of the little gun. When women learn to take care of themselves as
               men take care of themselves, they will be free and strong as men, <em>mothers </em> of men, not mothers of cowards and
               imbeciles.)</q>
            </p>
         
         <p> She was aglow with health and exuberant life. She turned to me: <q> Do you know you look absolutely utterly scrumptiously, bumptiously
               well?</q>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <q>I am!</q> Then it came back to me in a flash. <q>In returning and rest shall be your confidence</q>: the moving picture
            films of dreams, the half naked figure flying before the wolves; the vestured
            and hooded figure of death in the wheat fields, dead ripe below the upper Alpine
            meadows, where the disimprisoned waters laughed down from the upper peaks; and
            the whole world was flooded in moonlight that was silver, and the very hills
            echoed to the laugh;ter and gladness of the waters. She let halloo after halloo
            of sheer life out of her as we trotted down by moonlight that was silver to the
            ranch house; and I laughed. This time, the figure did not fly before the wolves;
            but the wolf fled before the figure, as all wolves flee before womanhood when
            you turn <em>and face and fight and pursue. </em>
            </p>
         
         <p> It is not part of this narrative to relate how I was begged to remain out in
            that free open life. The call of the open spaces needed no coaxing with me.
            Every year from that day to this, I have heeded the call once a year and gone
            out to the healing of forest and mountain and upper Alpine meadow; but a keener
            call had sounded in my soul, the call of Life, of zest, of service, of gladness
            in work, of a part in the great army marching to a new day; and like my friend,
            I would like to come back in a hundred years and see the new type of humanity,
            when suffering has eliminated the shirk and the skulk and the slug and the
            parasite and the sheep; when the dawn of a new century &#x2014; woman's
            century&#x2014; has grown to full and perfect day! No more book lore for me! No
            more culture snobbery! No more Chinese foot-bindings of caste upon my soul; but
            rather life and the thick of it, strife and stress, hard or easy, learning the
            cohesiveness and solidarity of the Sisterhood of Service! </p>

         </a><h4>The Panic of 1907</h4>
      <p> The author could be referring to The Panic of 1907 which was a
         financial crisis that took place in the United States over a three-week period
         starting in mid-October, when the New York Stock Exchange fell almost 50% from its
         peak the previous year. Panic occurred, as this was during a time of economic
         recession, and there were numerous runs on banks and trust companies. The 1907 panic
         eventually spread throughout the nation when many state and local banks and
         businesses entered bankruptcy.</p>
      <a id="Astarte" href="#n6"> *
         </a><h4>Astarte/Astoreth</h4>
      <p> Astarte is one of a number of names associated with the chief
         goddess or female divinity of both Canaanite and Phoenicians. Astarte was connected
         with fertility, sexuality, and war. Her symbols were the lion, the horse, the
         sphinx, the dove, and a star within a circle indicating the planet Venus. Astarte
         was worshipped in Syria and Canaan beginning in the first millennium BC and was
         first mentioned in texts from Ugarit. She came from the same Semitic origins as the
         Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar, and an Ugaritic text specifically equates her with
         Ishtar. Her worship spread to Cyprus, where she may have been merged with an ancient
         Cypriot goddess. This merged Cypriot goddess may have been adopted into the Greek
         pantheon in Mycenaean and Dark Age times to form Aphrodite. She is referred to in
         the Hebrew Bible and is referred to by some as one of God&#x2019;s Old Testament rivals.

         </a><h4> Moloch/Molech/Molek </h4>
      <p> Moloch is a name or term that appears several times in the
         Hebrew Bible, primarily in the book of Leviticus. The Bible strongly condemns
         practices associated with Moloch, which appear to have included child sacrifice.
         Since the medieval period, Moloch has often been portrayed as a bull-headed idol
         with outstretched hands over a fire; this depiction takes the brief mentions of
         Moloch in the Bible and combines it with various sources, including ancient accounts
         of Carthaginian child sacrifice and the legend of the Minotaur.Moloch has been used
         figuratively to refer to a person or thing demanding or requiring a very costly
         sacrifice. A god Moloch appears in various works of literature, such as John
         Milton's Paradise Lost (1667), Gustave Flaubert's Salammbô (1862), and Allen
         Ginsberg's "Howl" (1955). He is referred to by some as one of God's Old Testament
         rivals.</p>
