            <p>It may be objected that this interpretation of Woman and Work so far
               deals only with girls who have had the background of education, home,
               helpful associates. What of the myriads who are thrust by necessity out
               on life with no education, with no training, with no fitness? What of
               the tens of thousands in every big city who are plunged into the vortex
               of driving industry with no home for fortress of retreat in times of
               illness, idleness, discouragement? What of those, who have either no
               associates, or only associates, who drag them down? Many a girl has had
               to choose between a loneliness more unbroken than prison life, without
               the security of prison life, and associates, that she knew to be
               detrimental. Shall we pass judgment of condemnation when she chooses
               wrong? How much better would we have done in her place?</p>
            
            <p>In other words, if you were on the ragged edge nothing; if you had no
               home but such as you made for yourself; if you had no savings and had
               never earned wages that permitted savings; if you had little strength
               and were spasmodically losing your nerve from fear of want; if you had
               no security against want, and lost your job, and couldn't get another,
               what would you do? Particularly, what would you do, if you were a woman
               past forty, physically a good deal the worse for the wear and tear of
               city life; with streaks gray in your hair that put you at a discount
               competing against the nimble agility of youth? Having through no fault
               of your own, started wrong, is there any vocation where you could begin
               again, where your mature experience could count against the nimble
               fingers of youth?</p>
            
            <p>Because there is such a chance for every woman out from the vortex of the
               city's great unemployed, out from under the wheels of the Juggernaut<a id="n1" href="#juggernaut">*</a> car, I am going to set down,
               with as strict accuracy to detail as I can recall, the story told to me
               word for word by one who found a way out, which every woman in like case
               could follow if she would. At the time of writing this, there has just
               been a meeting in New York of the city's unemployed women<a id="n2" href="#unemployMtgs">*</a>; and women, who had never
               before in their lives faced an audience, stood up and voiced the cry for
               work, for a chance to live. Among the white goods workers alone, it was
               found that more than 22,000 were working on half time, that is, at wages
               from $3.50 to $4.50<a id="n3" href="#conversion1">*</a> a
               week. Among the shirtwaist and kimono makers, 10,000 were entirely out
               of work, 14,000 on half time. Of the 75,000 women workers, allied with
               women's trades unions in New York alone, 22,000 had been permanently
               laid off work for the winter. When you consider that of all industrial
               workers among women, not a tenth ally themselves with any trades unions
               whatsoever, it is a pretty safe estimate to say that at least 100,000
               women workers in industry are out of work in each of the big cities of
               the East in winter. This estimate is considered under the mark by the
               union women of New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore.</p>
            </div>
         
         <div class="div3">
            
            <p>What is the cause of it? Not hard times; for this country has never at
               any era in its history suffered hard times as that phrase is understood
               in other lands. Transition in styles, such as women no longer wearing
               yards and yards of white petticoats, may have something to do with one
               trade; but that is only a surface shift of the great economic current
               throwing such multitudes adrift.</p>
            
            <p>If you look for the real cause, you will find it, not in shifting styles,
               but, as one woman, who began life at fourteen as a cap maker, expressed
               it, in the perfection of the machine. One machine to-day does the work
               of five cash girls; one typewriter, the work of a dozen long-hand
               secretaries; one sewing machine, driven at top speed by electricity, the
               work of fifty women at hand-sewing; one canning factory, with machinery
               self-driven and almost automatic, supplants "mother's home-made pickles
               and preserves&#x201d; in ten thousand families.</p>
            
            <p>Do the workers, then, curse the machine and mob the inventor, as the
               weavers did a hundred years ago in England<a id="n4" href="#luddites">*</a>? Not a bit of it! I have never heard the
               faintest shade of resentment in tone toward the machine. Workers to-day
               realize that the machine has become the burden bearer of the age, a
               thing making possible ease of production in a way ancient wizards never
               dreamed and fairy tales could not invent.</p>
            </div>
         
         <div class="div3">
            
            <p>Meanwhile, what happens? Fingers of fourteen, fifteen, sixteen to twenty
               years old are nimbler, quicker, safer with the swift speeding shuttles,
               or steel cutters, or pleaters, than fingers of thirty-five to forty.
               Also in an age when competition is fierce as of old, and overhead
               expenses the heaviest ever known, fingers of fourteen, fifteen, sixteen
               are cheaper than the fingers of a mature and experienced woman, who has
               a right to expect to be paid for her knowledge as well as her
               mechanism.</p>
            
            <p>Good! Turn on the power! Whirl the wheels! Watch the shuttles flying so
               fast they are a blur to the eye! What happens? Those nimble fingers age
               twenty-five don't go so fast. The machine power has flagged and fagged
               the nerve power. At twenty-eight, there is an accident, or broken
               finger, or a functional smashup from exhausted vitalities. If you look
               over large audiences of the unemployed, you will be impressed by the
               fact that 75 per cent. of the idle are those over thirty-five years old;
               25 per cent., those under sixteen. At thirty-five and forty, is it to be
               the scrap heap? That is the question these armies of women in industry
               are asking themselves; and the fact that there are any hundred thousand
               women out of work, who want to work, who are desperate to work, who
               demand to live unharried by constant Fear of Want&#x2014;by the Spectre
               of Gaunt Hunger&#x2014;is more than the sign of a startling economic
               transition. It is the century tragedy of a machine age. It is the
               Frankenstein<a id="n5" href="#frankenstein">*</a> of our
               generation, when the horror we have created devours its own
               offspring.</p>
            
            <p>Is it necessary? Granted these out-of-works are drifters on an economic
               tide, which they can't control. Are so many hundreds of thousands a year
               to be permitted to become the flotsam and jetsam of humanity? If so, it
               will come high in cost for hospitals and asylums and places of refuge.
               It will come still higher in bitter social discontent and hatred.
               Socialists say&#x2014;take over all instruments of production for the
               public! Doctrinaires<a id="n6" href="#doctrinaires">*</a>
               say&#x2014;let the government give these people a job! Philanthropists
               say&#x2014;let us give these people immediate help! The first two
               suggestions accomplish nothing; for they are years away; and the
               out-of-works are with us here and now, hungry and sullen at life. The
               last remedy relieves immediate need; but it doesn't go down to
               fundamentals; and it offends self-respect; and it is like baling out
               water thrown in by the waves of a continuous tide. It helps; but it
               doesn't stop. Then, there is the system being tried successfully in
               Germany and New Zealand and Australia, government insurance against old
               age and want through a system of small weekly deductions from
               earnings<a id="n7" href="#welfare">*</a>; but this, like the
               remedies suggested by the Socialists and doctrinaires, does not relieve
               immediate want. This system is not in vogue yet, and requires years to
               bring its beneficiaries any returns.</p>
            
            <p>There is no use saying&#x2014;these people are <em>un-fits</em>; or they would have hoisted themselves out of their
               predicament by their own efforts. As well tell a man to lift himself up
               by his boot straps. They are not <em>un-fits</em>.
               They are <em>misfits</em>. You show <em>how</em>; and they will do the hoisting themselves all
               right. It isn't&#x2014;what <em>can a woman do</em>,
               which implies a victim in a trap. It is&#x2014;<em>what
                  a woman can do</em>, which implies a way out of dilemmas; so I shall
               tell the absolutely true story of the woman who found her way out, as
               nearly in her own words as possible:</p>
            </div>
         </div>
      
      <div class="div2">
         
         <div class="div3">
            
            <p>''I belonged to that type of family from which so many girls who have to
               earn their living come. We were neither rich nor poor. We were never in
               debt; but we never saved. My mother did not believe in the new fashion
               of women going out to earn a living. She believed that every woman
               should marry early and settle down with a little family of her own. She
               did not believe in what you call women-in-industry. Neither did I. I did
               not think that was what women were made for; and I used to feel a little
               bit of superiority and contempt, when my old girl friends of the high
               school began going out to work in offices and factories. We lived in a
               little New England factory town. If you know anything about factory
               towns, you will know that the successful men of the family drift to the
               city, while the women stay on in the factories.</p>
            
            <p>"You can think anything you like about marrying; but there simply aren't
               enough men to go round in these little villages, any more than there are
               in England. Now that it is all over and done with, I know where I made
               my first terrible mistake and sinned, and have paid in suffering for my
               sin; but lots of women do the same thing; and it doesn't turn out a
               mistake. I believed I was doing what it was the duty of every woman to
               do&#x2014;marry; and it seems a poor sort of joke now; but I would rather
               have died young than had my name go on a tombstone as an 'old maid.'
               That used to be one of the jokes of our house. Well, I married! I
               suppose at the time I thought I was marrying for love; but I know now
               that I wasn't, that I married for a home, for a man to support me, as
               thousands of other girls marry; and I was too young to realize that the
               man I had chosen, married me as a sort of protection against his own
               waywardness. He needed support that I couldn't give, that I wasn't old
               enough to give him. I think we both unconsciously tricked each other. He
               thought if he married a good girl, it would keep him straight. I thought
               if I married a smart fellow, it would protect me from the blasts of the
               world. You see we were both simply loving self and didn't know it. Our
               marriage was a cheat on both sides.</p>
            
            <p>"My brother and I had gone on an excursion to New York for the day. The
               man, I was to marry, was one of the old boys from our high school. We
               met him by chance on the street, and he asked us to have lunch with him
               in one of the big Broadway restaurants. Jokingly, my brother turned to
               me as we were going to meet him in the restaurant: 'There is a catch for
               you, Sade! Mack earns twelve-hundred a year as bookkeeper in Wall St.
               and you can judge from his dress and style of living how much he must
               earn on the side.' My brother always said something like that to me,
               when I met a likely man. I didn't answer; but I thought a lot. He was
               the best dressed man I had ever met; and he looked so prosperous. You
               could see the waiters jump to serve him the minute he entered. Though I
               was a country simpleton, I had eyes in my head and couldn't help seeing
               how the necks of all the women in the restaurant craned as he passed.
               The check he paid for our lunch amounted to seven dollars; and he tipped
               the waiter fifty cents<a id="n8" href="#conversion2">*</a>.
               Then, he took us to a matinee. At the train, saying good-by, he told us
               he intended to spend his holidays back home for the first time in years.
               My brother looked at me queerly. On the train, he said: 'Mack always was
               a four-flusher spending. Only thing I have against him is that diamond
               ring he wears on his little finger.' How could I confess that diamond
               ring was on my own finger under my glove, where I had promised to wear
               it till he came up for his holidays?</p>
            
            <p>"We were married at the end of his holidays. The only inkling of anything
               amiss came from an old maid aunt, who threw cold water on everybody and
               everything. She was knitting in the corner by the chimney the day before
               our wedding.</p>
            
            <p>" 'So he is a free spender,' she said. She always clicked her needles
               when she was going to say something horrid. 'It's all right for them as
               has it,' clicking very fast and hard, 'but them as has it don't usually
               spend it; and them as spend it don't usually have it.'</p>
            </div>
         
         <div class="div3">
            
            <p>"It shocked my country ideas to find we were paying a rent of $50 a month
               for our small apartment east of Fourth Avenue near 23rd Street. It
               seemed a great deal to pay half one's income in rent. At home, when my
               father earned $60 a month, we never paid more than $10 for rent<a id="n9" href="#conversion3">*</a>; but when I spoke to my
               husband about it, he told me to leave business matters to him. He would
               leave household matters to me. It would affect his standing with the
               fellows, if they thought he couldn't afford as good an apartment for his
               wife, as these bachelor boys had for themselves. Who the fellows were, I
               didn't know. Not a soul came to see us for that first year in New York.
               It was fearfully lonely. I have often wondered if there is no way for
               all the lonely people in the big cities to meet and comfort one another.
               I used to be glad to pass the time of day with the hall boy, or the milk
               man; and there didn't seem any way to form friends, or make
               acquaintances. I used to clean the apartment and reclean it and walk the
               streets and parade the departmental stores to keep from being physically
               sick with loneliness; but in the evenings and on Sundays, when my
               husband was home, we were very happy. I really think it is that kind of
               loneliness drives so many young people out to the dance halls, and the
               moving pictures, and the cheap restaurants. We got into the way of going
               to the cheap shows on Saturday nights, and to the cheap restaurants for
               dinner on Sundays. That is all we could afford. Really, we couldn't
               afford that; but I didn't know it. I used to long for the birth of our
               baby for company. I had intended to go up home for the baby; but my
               father died that winter; and my mother went to live with a married
               brother.</p>
            
            <p>" ' So you won't go up home for the arrival of His Little Royal
               Highness?' my husband asked.</p>
            
            <p>" 'How can I?' I answered.</p>
            </div>
         
         <div class="div3">
            
            <p>''He seemed terribly worried. I asked him if finances were not all right.
               He answered, 'of course!' Would I never learn to leave finances to him?
               Business was for men; and so on, like that! It was a day or two after
               that the diamond ring was missed, the one he had given me that afternoon
               at the matinee. I wanted to have the police question the hall boys; but
               my husband would not hear of it, that would only put the thief on guard.
               He would employ a private detective to rake the pawn shops. That night,
               he was late coming home to dinner. I was wild with anxiety and
               nervousness; and I could not go out for him. I tried to telephone the
               Wall St. brokerage firm; but the office had closed for the day. It was a
               rainy summer night, that brought back the very smells of the rose
               gardens up home. A hurdy-gurdy<a id="n10" href="#hurdy-gurdy">*</a> was playing, 'The Wearing of the Green,'<a id="n11" href="#wearingOfGreen">*</a> or something in the street below our
               window; and a lot of ragged children were dancing round and round in the
               gutter. A faint feeling came over me. What if anything happened so that
               our child would be a poor youngster like those below the window? Had I
               done all my part? Was the woman's part to let the man support her? In
               olden days, women used to spin and sew and make all the food. Now, all
               that is done outside. I can never hear a hurdy-gurdy yet without that
               same faint feeling, it was a sort of horror.</p>
            
            <p>"There is no use going back over that night. It cripples me to dwell on
               it. I wanted to send for the police; but was afraid. I sat paralyzed all
               night listening and listening for steps. By and by, all the steps
               stopped, and there was nothing but the roar of the Third Avenue L. By
               morning, I was walking the floor with terror. The minute the clock
               pointed nine, I called up the brokerage office. The boy, who answered,
               didn't know who was speaking and for a second didn't catch the name.
               Then, he said, 'Oh! yes, Mack, he ain't been here for weeks! He was
               fired for swoipin' office funds!'</p>
            
            <p>''I was stunned. I couldn't believe it. I wouldn't let myself think of
               the missing ring; but the morning mail killed my last hope. It was a
               little curt note. It said: 'Don't try to trace me. There has been a
               mix-up in the office checks. If you trace me, it will end in my arrest
               and your disgrace. Better go back home.</p>
            </div>
         
         <div class="div3">
            
            <p>"Home! There was no home; and he knew it. I, who had married to escape
               facing life and earning a living outside the home, had now to earn a
               living for two! I was untrained. I was unskilled. I was temperamentally
               unfit for any kind of work but in a home. I was one of the thousands of
               helpless women thrown on the big cities, the very fate I had married to
               escape. I was ashamed to go back to my native place, humiliated and
               disgraced. There was no place for me there. My brothers had married. One
               was supporting mother; and his wife resented that. Our home factories
               were running slack. There was no work there.</p>
            
            <p>&#x201c;I didn't come to my senses enough to know what to do till I was
               convalescing from the birth of the baby in the maternity hospital. I
               used to think I would be so happy when the baby came; but now I couldn't
               look at him without crying out as if something stabbed me. Furniture, we
               paid $1,200 for, I sold to the second hand shops for $300. Of that, $50
               went to the maternity hospital, and $50 for the rent of the apartment
               the month I had been away. That left me $200. While I worked, I arranged
               to have the baby cared for in the day at a church nursery. Then I paid
               $50 for a special course in stenography and typewriting with the use of
               a machine for practice. That left me $150. I rented a little back hall
               bedroom with the use of a bathroom, where I could do my own washing and
               light cooking. This took $3.50 a week. Try as I would, I could not keep
               my living expenses down lower than 30 cents a day, 5 cents for
               breakfast, coffee and a roll without butter; 10 cents for lunch near the
               shorthand school, a sandwich and coffee; and 15 cents for supper, coffee
               and a roll and soup, or a small piece of meat, a cheap cut; and when it
               rained so that I had to take the car to and from the shorthand school, I
               had to skip one meal to keep my expenses down to 30 cents a day. That
               made my living $5.60 a week. I used to count and count at night, that,
               at this cost, my principle couldn't last longer than thirty weeks, and I
               had made up my mind never to spend my last $10<a id="n12" href="#conversion4">*</a>. I always wanted enough left to reach my
               brothers. What if I were unable to learn in thirty weeks? What if I
               couldn't get a position? The papers were full of accounts of girls lured
               to dens through advertisements for stenographers.</p>
            </div>
         
         <div class="div3">
            
            <p>"It is right here that if some of the able rich women, who want to help,
               would, they could save so much suffering and waste. If I could have had
               some one, who was not knocked silly with fright, to advise me in the
               hospital, I should not have studied stenography at all. I should have
               done then what I did two years later after such suffering I hate to
               recall it. I was not cut out for a stenographer. Spelling and
               punctuation always bothered me. A sharp word from the person dictating
               rattled me so I lost my head and made more blunders than ever. The only
               thing I loved doing and wanted always to do and had looked forward to
               doing as my life work&#x2014;was home making, cooking and sewing and
               housekeeping; but there was no one to tell me there was any market value
               for these things. I hadn't the faintest idea any more than any other
               young girl has that <em>while every other vocation is
                  crowded with more workers than there is work, the one vocation where
                  there is always more work than there are workers, the one vocation where
                  a capable girl can get pretty nearly any price she asks is home
                  making.</em> I suppose if I thought of it at all I thought of house
               work as being a servant, stuck away in a basement bedroom off a dark
               hall next to the ash cans. I didn't know there was such a thing as
               domestic science. I did know there was scientific nursing; but I didn't
               take up nursing because I didn't know what to do with my baby during the
               years of training. A woman worldly wise would have known all those
               things and could have told me.</p>
            
            <p>"The other way in which rich women could help is in training such misfits
               as I was to find and fill and fit a special place. Why should any girl
               at the very end of her resources have to pay out $50 to learn her job? I
               had thought of dress-making; but at one dress-making school where I
               applied, the cost would have been $60; and at a school of design, where
               I wanted to learn millinery, the charge would have been $40<a id="n13" href="#conversion5">*</a>. If the women, who form
               clubs for struggling girls would provide training for various
               vocations&#x2014;yes , even training in cooking&#x2014;they would have
               thousands of applicants a year, and could save girls from the employment
               sharks and fake design schools, where they are bled to their last
               dollar.</p>
            
            <p>''One other point for the women who want to help&#x2014;many a girl, when
               she has finished her training, has not enough money left to furnish car
               fare; and there begins a weary tramp over miles of city streets to
               places of possible employment. I have walked ten miles in a day, say
               from 60th Street to the Battery and back, and gone to a dozen different
               shops and offices, and found the same sign out on each door&#x2014;No
               Applicants for Work Needed. (Author's note: at
               the very time of writing this, a firm in New York moved into a large new
               departmental store. They advertised for 1,100 helpers. Only 500 of the
               applicants had had sufficient training to qualify them for the work; and
               of the 500, according to the manager, who employed them, only 50 were
               thoroughly competent, above the average. The firm was literally
               compelled to open a school to train its employees for its various
               departments, giving them a living wage during the course of training. If
               the associations for the betterment of women workers' lives could keep a
               roof over the strugglers, while they steered them into the training
               schools, a deal of waste could be saved, and incompetency, the basic
               fact of all struggling, could be prevented.)</p>
            </div>
         
         <div class="div3">
            
            <p>''At the end of four months training and searching, I did get a position
               in one of the big departmental stores, where one-hundred-and-fifty other
               stenographers were employed on the out-of-town mail order department. I
               got this position through the girl who shared the bathroom with me as a
               place to cook and wash. She was a manicurist, who received $1.50<a id="n14" href="#conversion6">*</a> a day in the ladies' parlor
               of the same store. She heard of a girl who was leaving and really had me
               slipped in before I knew it. She was a wonderful little thing, French, I
               think. She had come from San Francisco, working her way across the
               continent from point to point by manicuring. She had paid her
               Pullman<a id="n15" href="#pullman">*</a> fare from Omaha to
               New York by manicuring ladies' nails on the train. I asked her why she
               had come to New York. She said she wanted 'to see life,' and she 'meant
               to land some swell guy with money.' I asked her what she would have done
               in my case. She said before any man 'got' her, he would have to settle
               so much money on her 'snug and tight' before the ceremony. Her views
               left me sort of sick; but then, had my motives been any better? She was
               full of catchwords she had heard at lectures about 'efficiency' and
               'average' and 'sub-average' and ' super-average'; about plans to get on.
               She said she, herself, was only 'an average'; but she meant to be a
               'super -average.' She told me one of our women who was a foreign buyer
               had a salary of $7,500 a year, and that the head cashier or auditor on
               the main floor, a married woman about thirty-five years of age, got
               $5,000 a year and had never been caught in a mistake in ten years. She
               said that both these women had begun in the Chicago branch of the store
               at $1.50 a week. They had come to work with their &#x2018;hair in pig tails
               tied with a shoe string.' They were pointed out as examples of what we
               might become; but the hitch in that was they were perfect fits; we were
               misfits. They were cut out for exactly the work they were doing. I was
               not fitted for the work I was doing. I had always been called a perfect
               housekeeper; and in the matter of buying household supplies and clothes,
               I could make a dollar go as far as most women make ten; but in
               stenography, my fingers were all thumbs. I didn't think quickly and
               grasp the meaning; so that I was always slow. In my work, I was very
               much a 'sub-average.' I was a fore-ordained failure. My wages were $6 a
               week; and, looking back now, I know it was more than I was worth. I
               broke my machine on an average once a month. Twice, the repairs cost $2.
               I was not docked for them. I often had to do the simplest letters over
               twice; and though I was called down for erasures, I was never dismissed
               for my blunders. I think that was because it was so plain that I was
               trying hard. I had to take a cheaper room, this time at $2.50 a week, so
               near the store that would never need to take the street car. Later, I
               found a room far over on the West side below 12th Street at $1.50 a
               week. I was now able to cut my living expenses down to $1.50 a week.
               This left $3<a id="n16" href="#conversion7">*</a> to clothe
               the baby and myself. The baby, after the first month, I left with a
               German woman who lived in the same tenement. She took care of that baby
               in the day for nothing. I want to tell that; because that is the kind of
               help that counts for more than the investigations of vice committees, or
               the lectures of philanthropists. We are told that girls who work in the
               factories and stores should save for holidays and old age. If any one
               will tell me how I could save off that salary, I wish they would. One
               day I remember I was sent from the stenographers' department to pilot an
               out-of town customer round the store. She asked me what I was paid, and,
               when I told her, threw up her hands.</p>
            
            <p>" 'Why in the world don't you go West?' she asked. 'Out West, they pay
               apple and orange pickers $2 and $3<a id="n17" href="#conversion8">*</a> a day. You girls are like our orange
               growers, before they learned how to distribute their oranges on the
               market. Oranges used to lie and rot on our ranches. Then, we found out
               how to distribute oranges; and now no orange grower loses. Why do you
               stay congested in these big centers like rats in a cellar?'</p>
            
            <p>"I looked her straight in the eye. 'Lady,' I said, 'I don't go West
               because I can't walk.'</p>
            
            <p>&#x201c;I don't think she heard me. She was talking in blue streaks like
               this&#x2014;'Perfect outrage to pay such wages! Don't wonder girls go to
               the devil' (I wanted to tell her they didn't; not half as much as idle
               women. They hadn't time; but she never stopped for breath.) 'Women
               should boycott stores that pay such wages.' (She had just bought a
               sealskin sacque<a id="n18" href="#sacque">*</a> from us.) 'A
               law ought to be passed establishing a minimum wage of $12 at the least
               for any girl, who works.' (What difference would that have made, I
               wonder! There were lots of girls in our store getting more than $12. It
               was because I was a misfit that I did not earn more. If such a law were
               passed, the store would simply be compelled to throw out us
               'sub-averages' and double up high speed work for those left.) 'Why,
               there are millions of homes in the West that can't get help for love or
               money, not for $40<a id="n19" href="#conversion9">*</a> a
               month and board. Why do you stay in these city rat holes? Why don't you
               go West?'</p>
            
            <p>"She might as well have asked me&#x2014;why don't you jump over the moon.
               'Lady,' I said, good and hard this time, 'I don't go West because I
               can't walk.'</p>
            </div>
         
         <div class="div3">
            
            <p>"And that's another way the strong women could help the weak, if they
               wanted to; but, after all, we have to work it out for ourselves. Several
               things impressed me more and more the longer I was in that store. We
               girls and women were on the wrong tack. You can't get joy out of work
               unless it is a sort of personal service. Unless you own your job in some
               sort of permanent way, you won't sing over it. My grandfather was a
               shoemaker; and he always sang as he cobbled. My father went into a
               factory; and he never sang. He got crusty and short over his work. Then,
               speed is the key note of success in modern work. You work up speed; then
               you speed up more. You live a sort of breathless existence that isn't
               life. If the machine breaks, a new one is bought. If the operator
               breaks, a new operative is got. It eats up your youth, and gives you
               back only a crust of bread. The more experienced you are, the less value
               you are. That is why so many women workers call themselves Miss when
               they are Mrs., and wear false bangs, and dye their hair. I began to call
               myself Miss, my second year. The forewoman told me&#x2014;'We don't like
               customers to think we are an old lady's home'!</p>
            
            <p>''Then, John Rockefeller<a id="n20" href="#rockefeller">*</a> can talk 'save,' to the crack of doom.
               There is no 'save,' or 'safe' either for us 'sub-averages.' When I moved
               from our first apartment to the back hall room, I was still in a decent
               neighborhood. When I moved to the $1.50 room, the neighborhood was
               decent enough but it was not sanitary. There was no elevator in the
               tenement; and there was no ventilation. You could smell stale toilets
               from the front stair. There was only one dirty bath room for each floor,
               and perhaps twenty-five tenants lived on each floor
               &#x2014;'sub-renters,' I suppose the little manicurist would have called
               'sub-averages' like myself. The windows of the inner court were littered
               with milk jars and plates of butter and meat placed on the ledge to keep
               cool; and Monday's washing always hung on lines stretched from window to
               window of the inner court. A wind could blow wash drip across our food.
               Some of the faces leering round the doors were terrible, fat
               half-dressed drunken women, and fat half-dressed sottish men. I have no
               judgment or blame for either the girls or the men. They were desperate
               for life. I used to feel after the end of the second year that, if I did
               not have a holiday or change, I would scream out with hysterics at
               night. I used to waken myself moaning in my sleep. I suppose these girls
               and men felt the same. They all looked as if they craved terribly for
               something. Where uptown folks drank champagne over beefsteak, these
               people had beer over chop suey. I guess they were as much God's children
               as the up-town folks, too! Once the German woman, who kept my baby, told
               me how the priest in her home village used to have his people come and
               dance on the village green every Sunday afternoon. For us, there was no
               village green. There were only the movies, the dance halls, Coney
               Island. There didn't seem any wholesome joy left in work.</p>
            </div>
         
         <div class="div3">
            
            <p>''One evening, when the beer drinkers grew screaming noisy, I took my
               baby, now a wee toddler, and went out for a walk. I wandered from Third
               Avenue over West across toward Madison along the brown stone fronts. A
               colored cook stepped from one of the basement doors and threw a tin of
               potted beef in the garbage can. Before knew it, I had the most terrible
               physical hunger for that can of potted beef, for ice-cream, for a 'fizz'
               drink, for beer, for anything with a taste, a lift, a kick to in, place
               of the soup slops I had been living on for two years. I wanted to break
               out and do something. Then, I knew what sent the girls in the tenement
               to the beer gardens and back room saloons. It was a craving of systems
               that were, well, you can't call them starved, but not nourished. A
               girl's body and soul crave something beside a crust of bread. It
               freightened me with the same faint sick feeling I had had that night the
               hurdy-gurdies played below the apartment window. I seemed to know
               suddenly why boys and girls went to hell. Those drunken leering fat men
               and women round the door, who often screamed and fought till daybreak
               had been boys and girls too, once. I think they fought and beat each
               other sometimes just for a nervous bust. I suddenly felt as if the city
               pavements were full of manholes that sucked youth down into sewers and
               cesspools; and surely God meant youth for something else. I thought He
               meant it for us to pass on to our children; and now I felt something
               wild and insurgent in me ready to go to hell. I suppose doctors would
               say that was the mother instinct in me starved. It wasn't. It was the
               soul and body of me starved for spiritual and physical food. I felt I
               would either have to harden and deaden; or go to Hell. I wonder if those
               girls, who go to Hell desperate for life, aren't better in God's eyes
               than we respectable girls are, who just quit feeling things by letting
               our souls turn to stone!</p>

            <p>&#x201c;I had been working now for over two years, and I had saved not a cent;
               and I knew other women more competent than I was, who had worked for
               twenty years and saved not a cent. I was now twenty-three. I had never
               been really hungry, but I craved everything a woman should have,
               nourishment, rest, fun, security. Surely, this is not much to demand of
               life. Surely, God meant us to laugh and dance and sing, to be secure
               from horror and want. I was only twenty-three; but I was losing my
               nerve. Why? Because I was, not unfit, but a misfit; and I was lonely
               with a loneliness that was sometimes a terrible deep black pit. It was
               just Hell. If I had not had the baby, but no, I'll not admit that,
               though God knows if I had not had the baby and any man asked me to have
               either beer or whiskey with him that night, I might have joined the
               noisy screams and dancers next door. I could have gone to hell in one
               jiffy! Anyway, I don't want to shock you and I don't suppose you'd
               publish it if I did say it, but after that night I somehow never could
               find it in my heart to condemn a girl in the big city even if she went
               ninety-nine times and nine, that's the Scripture number, isn't it<a id="n22" href="#biblicalNumbers">*</a>? straight to hell!</p>

            <p>"I made up my mind I'd place my baby in one of those church nurseries
               again; so he would be well nourished. I wonder, if in the bottom of my
               heart, I wanted to be free to have my fling. There was a shirtwaist
               factory down Fourteenth Street way, where I decided I'd try for a
               position at $10 a week, if I could only keep up the speed for those
               electric machines. I know you are wondering how I could be so stupid as
               not to learn that all these experiences were simply driving me from
               where I didn't belong to where I did belong, and where every woman
               belongs, into the one thing I was fit for; but I figured this way: $1.50
               a week would pay for my baby's keep; $1.50 more would pay for my room. I
               would have to raise on the cost of food and clothing. I was going under.
               Put these at $3 a week. I could still do my own washing and cleaning on
               Sundays. That would leave $4 a week! $4 a week might mean $200<a id="n23" href="#conversion11">*</a> a year saved, if you didn't
               mangle a finger, or break down, or lose your job in slack seasons. As I
               said before, I am not quick. I am 'sub-average.' I am faithful and
               thorough. Could I risk my certain job for an uncertain try!</p>

         <div class="div3">
            
            <p>"I kept thinking of it all week till Sunday, when I went to arrange for
               the baby to go out to the country with the church nursery. That last ten
               dollars, I had faithfully kept all these two years tucked in an envelope
               pinned inside my dress. If I were a misfit and 'sub-average,' at any
               cost I must find the place I could fit and reconstruct my life. I must
               quit being a round peg in a square hole. I must stop drifting; or I
               would end a wreck. I skipped lunch and spent my 10 cents<a id="n24" href="#conversion12">*</a> taking the 'bus out Fifth
               Avenue. At 86th Street where the conductor calls 'all out,' I noticed a
               handsome girl in the costume of a trained nurse, wheeling a baby
               carriage and leading another child about three years old by the hand.
               No! Don't you think help came rushing out of the rich house to me like
               the fairy god-mother! It didn't; and it never does. We have to work it
               out ourselves; but just as I came down off the 'bus, that little two
               year old dived away from his keeper straight in front of a big touring
               car. No, I didn 't save his life! It isn't any wonder yarn I'm telling
               you. I grabbed him by the neck and humped him back kicking to the
               trained nurse. He fought and screamed; and for a minute, I held the
               little carriage to keep it from blowing over in the wind. The costumed
               nurse thanked me without looking up; but a thought had come to me in a
               flash.</p>
            </div>
         
         <div class="div3">
            
            <p>" 'Excuse me,' I said, 'but are you a trained hospital nurse?'</p>
            
            <p>"Then, she looked up. She must have sized up in one glance my sallow
               gaunt face, and shabby genteel pride, and draggled dress. There were
               tags on my petticoats. Being a nurse she must have known that I had
               skipped meals.</p>
            
            <p>" 'Sure I am,' she laughed. 'I began as a trained hospital nurse; and
               here I am ending up a baby nurse for this naughty pair! What is the
               matter with you; and where do you work?'</p>
            
            <p>&#x201c;I mentioned the name of the big store.</p>
            
            <p>" 'And get about twenty-five a month, and spend it all slaving your life
               out. Well, I'm not sorry for you! You might as well be in a good home
               saving as much as the Quane of England had for spending money. If I
               could spend five years and seven hundred dollars on my education and
               don't consider it a come down to do what I'm doing, you girls, who are
               between the devil and deep sea, shouldn't consider your dignity such
               fine china that it would go to smash over domestic science.' (Author's note: whoever the nurse was, she enunciated
               simple truth. The Queen of England had less than $25<a id="n25" href="#conversion13">*</a> a month for an allowance as a girl; and
               the new system of nursing established in many European cities, combining
               kindergarten, Montessori features and hospital training, costs about
               seven hundred dollars and takes nearly five years.)</p>

         <div class="div3">
            
            <p>" 'Quane,' that is the way she said it. I never saw that nurse again and
               she probably never thought of me again; but her sound hard sense had
               sort of kicked a door open out of my trap. What was it the average girl
               looked forward to as her life work? What was it she wanted? Home-making,
               the trained nurse had called it 'domestic science.' What was it the
               average woman was best fitted for?&#x2014;Home-making. What was the one
               vocation in which I was not 'sub-average' nor even 'average,' but was
               always 'super-average'? Home-making&#x2014;domestic science&#x2014;the
               science for which every other science and vocation exist.</p>
            
            <p>"And here I was among the army of misfits, because I hadn't had sense to
               find my fit. Was that trained nurse, getting probably twenty a week and
               board, any lonelier than I in my back tenement room, with not a cent
               above the margin of mere existence? Was she not safer, securer, happier?
               But she had called it domestic science. Was home-making a science? I
               began to figure out what she said about saving. Could I but get
               twenty-five<a id="n26" href="#conversion14">*</a> a month and
               keep, I could save three times more than John Rockefeller
               had earned the first ten years of his life. Gee! It made me dizzy! I
               felt as if I had been having a nightmare and had just wakened up.</p>
            
            <p>"Years ago, what had sent our New England boys and girls into factories?
               The fact that they could earn bigger money in the factories than in the
               home; that there were more factory jobs than home jobs; but now, was
               there a single home in all New York, was there a home in all the United
               States, always sure of home help? Was there enough domestic help to go
               round all the homes in the United States?</p>
            
            <p>''We women had been hopelessly on the wrong tack. We had been shunning
               training for the one thing we all looked forward to. I thought of what
               the customer from the West had said to me&#x2014;'There are millions of
               homes can't get help for love or money, for $40 a month and board.'
               Wasn't it the same right here in New York, where I had been starveling
               along, where a hundred thousand like me were always starveling along?
               What was the matter with us? Was it the word 'servant'? Were we such
               snobs? Was 'servant' any worse badge than 'slave'; and were women, whose
               very lives depended on permission to operate a machine owned by some
               man, any better than slaves with a serf's ring round their necks? Why
               did we shun domestic help? Few of the factory women earned more than $12
               a week. The majority did not earn $6 steady the year round. A good nurse
               help to look after children, a good housekeeper, a good general help
               could earn at the least $25 a month and board and clothes with two
               afternoons off a week; at the most up to $40 and $50 clear, that trained
               nurse must have been earning $100<a id="n27" href="#conversion15">*</a> clear. <em>What was the
                  matter with us that we shunned this one open door, and batted our stupid
                  brains out against the wall of the impossible in industrial
                  life?</em></p>

            <p>"What a woman can save is the exact measure of her security against want
               and danger. In domestic vocations, she can save practically four-fifths
               of what she earns. In industrial vocations she can save&#x2014;what can
               she save? (State and federal statistics show that
               the average earnings in industrial vocations are under $6<a id="n28" href="#conversion16">*</a> a week&#x2014;Author's
               note.) I could save nothing. I was on the ragged edge of want and
               desperation, and don't forget the night I craved the can of potted meat!
               I was on the ragged edge of plain hell. In this vocation, honesty,
               thoroughness, faithfulness had a market value. Had they fed into the
               electric-sped-up, devil's inventions of machines? Domestic vocations
               demanded a uniform. So did our stenographic. We had to wear black
               dresses with white cuffs and collars. So does a nun's vocation demand a
               costume. So does the trained nurse's; and that costume protects her
               wherever she goes. So does an ambassador's vocation demand a costume.
               Why should domestic help resent a uniform? What was the matter with us?
               Were we fools and victims of words? Were we to be sneered out of life by
               prejudice? Were we foolish snobs?</p>

            <p>(Author's Note: There isn't a well-to-do home
               to-day that isn't on the ragged edge of desperation for help; and there
               isn't a city today that hasn't its armies of women, thrown on the scrap
               heap by industry, on the ragged edge of desperation for a home. Why
               don't they come together? Is the washing of dishes so much more
               repulsive than the washing of small-pox sores by the trained nurse, or
               the swabbing of diphtheritic throats, or the anointing of syphilitic
               contagions, which any nurse in every hospital has to do any day of her
               life at imminent risk to her own health? Are we so democratic in this
               most democratic of all nations that it is really snobbery that drives a
               hundred thousand women a year on the scrap heap of industrialism? Let us
               banish the word "servant," and substitute the word domestic help, as we
               have substituted the word surgeon for leech! All of which reminds me of
               a curious experience of my own recently. I was interested in a little
               girl, who was wrecking her health studying for a vocation she could
               never possibly fill with financial profit to herself. She was a splendid
               little housekeeper, thorough, conscientious, careful; and I asked her
               mother why she didn't let her daughter take a course in domestic science
               instead of plugging at Latin and foreign languages. The mother looked at
               me with one long blank stare. ''Do you mean&#x2014;do
               you&#x2014;mean&#x2014;servant?'' she slowly glowered. ''Of course I
               don't. I mean the science of domestic life&#x2014;the chemistry of
               cooking, the botany of gardening, the finances of housekeeping,&#x201d; I tried
               to explain. She almost threw me out of that house.</p> 
            <p>It may be
               asked, as the proof of the pudding is in the eating, would I, the author
               of this book, earn my living by manual labor. What one has done is a
               very much better answer than what one says one would do. As the
               narrative of this book shows, I stumbled into mental work because I
               hadn't the sense or independent vision to see how much happier,
               healthier and better I would have been taking up manual outdoor work.
               When health 'smashed, I learned my blunder. When sweat shop pressure was
               tried on one in mental work, I made up my mind henceforth never to be
               without my own sit-fast acres, where I could swat physical facts with my
               own physical hands. When tired out mentally, yes, I have trekked off to
               Europe, to Florida, to Grand Canyon, to the Pacific, and to the wilds;
               but the joy of the wilds has been to me that could work physically, cook
               my own meals, build my own camp fires, groom and saddle my own horse,
               paddle my own canoe, though I have had to ride fourty miles at a
               stretch, and have paddled for hours in storms that drenched me to the
               skin in ice cold water. Where was the fun? I answer, in being alive; in
               doing what I sweet-pleased physically; in proving to myself that my
               brains were not turning to punk and my muscles to the flabby consistency
               of jelly; in a word, in getting the Chinese boots<a id="n29" href="#chineseBoots">*</a> of conventional life off my soul, and
               the strangle-hold of a mummied, mural existence off my body. To-day, I
               never ask my help to do any thing on my land that I cannot turn to and
               do with my own hands if I need to. A woman known on three continents as
               the richest and most talented hostess on the Pacific Coast, a woman who
               has entertained royalty of England and royalty of India and presidents
               of our own land, and who has been entertained by all three, told me that
               when she and her husband were building one of their seaside houses, they
               grew so disgusted with the slow fumbling pace of the carpenters that
               when the outside work was finished, they summarily fired all help, and
               that she and her sister with their own hands finished the entire
               interior of the house, themselves, including lath work, plaster board,
               panels, fireplaces, floors, all but the actual placing of doors, windows
               and plumbing, which required skilled labor. I know another woman famed
               for her skill in outdoor sports who built her own summer house, except
               the foundation and walls and roof beams. When I asked her why she did
               it, she turned squarely on me, and retorted&#x2014;&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; So I
               confess I have no sympathy whatsoever with the half-baked snobbery that
               belittles and bewails manual work. Work to me is joy not woe; and the
               wail chiefly comes, not from the worth whiles, who do things, but from
               the half-way-ups insecure of their own climbing and the parasites, who

         <div class="div3">
            
            <p>To resume the story of the woman, who found her way out: ''I walked back
               to my mean tenement lodging from 86th Street, and, as I walked, I came
               to my decision. Even if I had been fitted, built on wires instead of
               nerves, for electrified machine-driven industry, where would it leave me
               at thirty-five? Worn out, with little saved, if a cent. In domestic
               science, I could save at least four-fifths of what I earned. The next
               day, I put my application in at two employment agencies for the position
               of domestic help. Here, again, is a place where the rich women who want
               to help, can. I had to pay a $2 fee at each employment agency; and the
               places found for me were neither suitable nor safe. In one, the man of
               the house was a danger for any woman inmate of that home. I left in a
               week. The wages were $5 a week. In the next place the woman was
               dishonest and unfair. She expected her help to rise at 5 and work till
               midnight. She was a boarding-house keeper. She paid $18<a id="n30" href="#conversion17">*</a> a month; and I had not been there a week
               before I knew that she had no intention of paying the wages unless
               compelled. She tried to make deductions for breakages. If women who can
               help want to, why not open a free employment agency, where· such as I
               can find the place for which we are fitted; where the character of the
               mistress and of the house and of the surroundings can be as thoroughly
               investigated as our characters are; where, if we are not fit, we can be
               trained to be fit.</p>
            
            <p>&#x201c;By this time I was discouraged by my change, but not downcast. I knew
               that my place must exist if only I could find it; but I was now reduced
               to that last $10 I had kept so carefully tucked inside my dress; for I
               had been reserving my room and paying the keep of the baby, while I
               experimented in finding a true vocation. I looked at that $10 long the
               night I came back from my second failure as a domestic help. Would I
               break it? Would I not? What had I been keeping it for? I wrote out a
               carefully worded advertisement&#x2014;'A place wanted by a thoroughly
               capable and reliable woman as domestic help where faithful work will be
               appreciated and situation will be permanent. The highest references
               given and required.' This, I placed in a conservative family daily. The
               answer came within twenty-four hours. I was requested to call on Madison
               Avenue not far from the corner on Fifth Avenue where I had encountered
               the hospital nurse. It was a beautiful, well-regulated home such as I
               had never before seen in my life. My new employer listened quietly as I
               told her my faltering story. Then, she asked me what I wished to know
               about her home. It was so surprising for me to be consulted by an
               employer as to my rights that I could not ask a word. I was engaged at
               $25<a id="n31" href="#conversion18">*</a> a month with board
               and uniform and two afternoons a week off, as general domestic help.
               Though some nights we were kept up till twelve by company, there were
               other times when the whole family went out, and we had no duties beyond
               two in the afternoon. When we were sent to the city on errands, we were
               sent in a motor, or given car-fare. Often theater tickets were given us.
               We had a sitting room to receive friends. I do not recall that hours of
               work were ever specified; but the work we had to do was; and when that
               was done, we were free to spend the day as we wished. I have again and
               again had pleasant trips with my employer. I often drive in the park
               with her. In the summer, we all go from town to their country place.</p>
            
            <p>"I had thought I would resent working under a mistress. Instead, I have
               found her a counselor and a friend. Once, when a brother, who was on the
               fruit vessels in the tropics, came to New York ill, she brought him to
               my room in her New York house and permitted me to nurse him back to
               health in her home.</p>

         <div class="div3">
            
            <p>"Strikes have come and strikes have gone. Hard times have thrown
               thousands out of employment; and I have never once known what the fear
               of want meant. My little boy is in a school; and I spend two afternoons
               a week with him. Though I began as general domestic help, like the
               trained nurse, at $25 a month, I have wound up as nursery governess at
               $35 a month; and now, my mother is housekeeper at $40<a id="n32" href="#conversion19">*</a> a month in the same home. Together, we
               earn more than my father ever earned in all his life, or than any two of
               my brothers earn; and we bank four-fifths of it.</p>
            
            <p>"What I ask myself is how could I ever have been such a fool as to welter
               about on the seas of uncertainty and danger and want in the industrial
               world as a 'sub-average,' when this, the manifest destiny of a woman,
               was awaiting me in the safe harbor of a home?&#x201d;</p>

      <h4>Juggernaut<a id="juggernaut" href="#n1">* </a></h4>
      <p>The term "juggernaut" is derived from the name of the Hindu god
         Jagannath, the "Lord of the Universe," who is a form of the god Vishnu. The term was
         poularized in Britain and the United States in the early 1800s by Anglican missionary
         Rev. Claudius Buchanan when the letters in which he described the "Juggernaut" as
         violent and bloody were published in Christian missionary magazines. What Buchanan
         witnessed was the ritual of Rath Yatra held in Puri, India. In this ritual, wooden
         forms
         of the gods are placed on large and towering carts and pulled through the streets
         of
         Puri. Over time, the meaning of "juggernaut" was separated from its origins to the
         point
         where the term is used today simply to refer to an unstoppable force. At the time
         this
         book was written, there would have likely been a distinction between the use of the
         proper "Juggernaut" and the informal "juggernaut." As such, the author's use of the
         proper "Juggernaut" in this text may be meant to evoke a more violent image in the
         reader's mind.</p>
