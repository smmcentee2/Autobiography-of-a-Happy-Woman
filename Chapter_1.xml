                   <p>Are there any happy women left on this good green earth? </p>
                   <p>One is constrained to ask because we are uni&#8211;
                       versally told that half the world in in rebel&#8211;
                   lion&#8212;the woman half. Married women in the
                   cage want to break in. In fact, half
                   a wolrd of women are supposed to be wailing
                   because they can't spend life in a sort of <foreign rend="italic">
                   dolce far niente <ptr xml:id="n7" target="#dolcefarniente" n="7"/></foreign> 
                   dream with both hands folded idly
                   in their laps. I say <quote>supposed,</quote> because, as
                   a matter of fact in real life, you know and I
                   know that the workers are the happy ones&#8212;
                   married or single&#8212;the workers are the ones
                   who sing; the idle the ones who wail.</p>
                   <p>We are told&#8212;just as if the world hadn't
                   known that fact for countless years&#8212;that the 
                   highest duty of life is manufacturing new hu&#8211;
                   man beings&#8212;alias babies; and that women are
                   in open revolt against this duty. Yet as a 
                   matter of fact&#8212;not platform twaddle&#8212;not
                   pyrotechnics to catch the vote of lustful men
                   &#8212;we know that the supply of love&#8211;born babies
                   is not dropping off; and that, for the first time
                   in the history of the race, as much thought 
                   and care are given to keeping the babies, that
                   are born, alive as to keeping up the birth 
                   rate of hypothetical unborn babies.</p>
                   <p>We are told by investigating commissions
                   that women, who work behind the counter,
                   over the typewriter, over the dish pan, in the
                   school room, above the loom, in the factory,
                   behind the broom are slaves of new industrial 
                   conditions; that they are desperately un&#8211;
                   happy; that when the first gray hairs come, 
                   the iron has entered into their sould, or some&#8211;
                   thing like that. <pc>(If the iron went as tonic in
                   fishy blood, and gave some kick to the whine
                   for self pity&#8212;a lifting kick, we'll say&#8212;there
                   might be some point to it.)</pc> But the women
                   that you know and I know&#8212;outside the peo&#8211;
                   ple on the job at so much per for investigating
                   commissions&#8212;behind the counter, over the
                   typewriter, above the loom, behind the broom;
                   the women, who do things in the home or out
                   of it, <emph rend="italics">who stand for plus, not minus,</emph> for per&#8211;
                   formers, not parasites&#8211;are not idly poking
                   irons of introspection in and out of their souls.
                   They literally don't understand what all this
                   talk hubbub is about. <quote>Big talk: little do</quote>&#8212;
                   I have heard some of them say.</p>
                   <p>I am a woman; and I am living in the thick
                   of life; and I have seen all sides of it; and I
                   have worked at high pace and high pressure
                   with fury and joy in the home and out of it;
                   and I do not find this wail of woe purporting
                   to come from womanhood rings true. It is
                   not true of me. It is not true of the women, 
                   who work, that I know. The women I know
                   who work&#8212;don't find love ashes of roses; nor
                   ashes of Sodom; nor joy, a fading phantom.
                   Life to the worker is a dream come true, with
                   nightmare giants of troubled sleep, some&#8211;
                   times, of course; but always at dawn, fear fad&#8211;
                   ing in light. I am not writing this because of
                   the standing policy of the average American
                   editor&#8212;to make all stories end happily. I am
                   not writing a story. I am setting down the 
                   actual facts of a life begun under handicap;
                   and I want to set down that the older I grow,
                   the more I find life a more beautiful thing
                   than all the school girl gush and pointless
                   longings of what the poets call <quote>youth.</quote>
                   No matter how hard we think our own special han&#8211;
                   dicap has been&#8212;poverty, or inherited disease, 
                   or the tradegy of wrong parenthood, or a per&#8211;
                   sonality hopelessly askew&#8212;I do not think any
                   life ever came into this world without its own
                   handicap. Why we are handicapped&#8212;who can
                   tell? It may be to compel the soul to work
                   out its own hardihood getting rid of the hand&#8211;
                   icap, or to commit suicide sinking under it.
                   When I call life a dream come true, it is not
                   in blindness to the wrecks and tradegies and
                   crimes that litter every foot of life's progress.
                   I know there are more tradegies hidden mute
                   in the home than ever wer shouted from the 
                   housetops by the Sisterhood of Disontent <ptr xml:id="n3" target="#Sisterhood of Discontent" n="3"/>
                   ; but I know alos how much of this waste of the
                   gift of life results from the collision with the
                   hidden handicap of the personality.</p>
                   <p>Having found life a dream come true, I ask
                   myself <pc>(as I know multitudes of women work&#8211;
                   ers inside and outside the home are asking
                   themselves)</pc> is all this wail of woe genuine? Is
                   the old world vocal of womanhood out of joint?
                   Is there a great Sisterhood of Discontent? Or
                   is it that we are so attuned to the wail of dis&#8211;
                   content that we fail to note a world vocal with 
                   the music of the spheres; joy at work; service
                   rendered in gladness, not grudgingly; zest of
                   life; reapers garnering sheaves in sunlight;
                   women laughing with children at play?</p>
                   <p>The new mental attitude to life has come so
                   unexpectedly that it has left some ancient sex&#8211;
                   poses forever behind; the wife&#8211;beater calling
                   himself <quote>woman's natural protector,</quote>and at
                   once proceeding to break her protected head;
                   the sheep&#8211;type of woman pretending she likes
                   that kind of protection; Amelia <ptr xml:id="n1" target="#Amelia" n="1"/> 
                   fainting with terror of her own safety in the arms of the 
                   wicked <ptr xml:id="n2" target="#DonJuan" n="2"/> 
                   ;<name>Don Juan</name>pretending he is 
                   a very devil of a fellow engaged in the busi&#8211;
                   ness of eating babies in the dark! Without
                   knowing it, we have somehow come to regard
                   self&#8211;pity as the beggar's hat of a mean spirit
                   stuck out for alms.The Heroine of old <pc>(she,
                   herslef, was never by any possibilty supposed
                   to be half&#8211;past sixteen)</pc>set out joyously, coyly,
                   I was going to say <quote>unblushingly</quote>&#8212;only, she 
                   was really supposed to blush bucketfuls&#8212;to
                   harpoon a man for her support; if a little
                   soulful longing were mixed in as a prime
                   flavor. To&#8211;;day, we tear that pose to ten thou&#8211;
                   sand analytic tatters. <quote>What's she after?</quote>
                   <quote>What can she do?</quote><quote>What's she going to 
                   give in return besides sweet smiles and sug&#8211;

                   if all she has to offer is sex, all draped in 
                   wistaria and roses and wistful soul longings,
                   of course, we aren't suprised that she gets
                   spurious coin back in return, bronze and cop&#8211;
                   per and brass and putty, where she expected 
                   pure gold.</p>
                   <p>Quite unknown to ourselves as a generation,
                   we have come to eye the parasite askance, be 
                   she rich or poor. It doesn't matter whether 
                   she belongs to the orchid or to the mosquito
                   family. The woman, who is sorry for herself
                   because she has to earn her living <emph rend="italics">outside</emph>the
                   home, is the very woman, who would be sorry
                   for herself earning her living <emph rend="italics">inside</emph>the home.
                   If she is sorry for herself in an office, what
                   would she be in the pangs of giving birth to a
                   new life?</p>
                   <p>My early days were passed in a Western
                   city during the depression of the collapse from 
                   one of the worst real estate booms, that ever
                   sent a whole community up in a crazy ballon
                   of inflated hopes, only to drop them in a ten 
                   years' slough of reaction. I remember one
                   speculator, who became a paper millionaire in 
                   anticipation of a railroad coming in, who, six
                   months after the advent of the new line, was
                   carried away to an asylum, where he passed
                   the rest of his days bent almost double pick&#8211;
                   ing up imaginary diamonds. A politician in 
                   the same place, who between dawn and dark
                   unexpectedly as a bolt out of the blue, had
                   made his half million, built a palace calling it
                   after some castle or other. When the boom
                   collapsed, he hadn't money enough of those
                   paper thousands to light the fire in his fur&#8211;
                   nace. He had to borrow money to leave the 
                   country.</p>
                   <p>In your mind, draw a line on the map from
                   <placeName>St.Louis<ptr xml:id="n4" target="#St. Louis" n="4"/></placeName> to 
                   <placeName>St.Paul <ptr xml:id="n5" target="#St. Paul" n="5"/></placeName>. 
                   The depression pre&#8211; vailing in our city was typical of conditions in
                   every little new hamlet west of that line from
                   the tme of the Panic of <time>1893</time> up to <time>1898</time>. At the
                   time, we were all desperately sorry for our &#8211;
                   selves. It isn't a pleasant awakening to think
                   you have a lot worth <measure type="currency">120,000</measure>, and to find in
                   a day that what you really have is a mortgage
                   debt for <measure type="currency">12,000</measure>, against property, which carries
                   taxes of <measure type="currency">3,000</measure> a year. We were all desperate&#8211;
                   ly sorry for ourselves. Yet, looking back, we
                   can all laugh at the hardships. We didn't 
                   laugh then. We hustled. Actual hunger never
                   came within the majority of homes; but it came
                   so near the doors that I can guess and have 
                   often as a child dreamed what the <name>Phantom
                   Fright</name>looks like when it stalks out of the dark
                   to sping at the struggler's throat. There
                   was one dream I used to have over and over
                   in the darkest years of the city's collapse. It
                   was of a half&#8211;naked figure flying along the
                   edge of a precipice with two wolves snapping
                   at its heels; and I do not think there were many
                   people in the city at that time, who did not
                   know what the sensations of the runner must
                   have been. We were all, every one of us, on
                   the edge.</p>
                   <p>Though hunger never actually entered most
                   of the homes, it came horribly near many a
                   home that kept a brave front face to the street.
                   We laugh when reminiscent now. We didn't
                   laugh then. I think it was the Spirit of the
                   West that sustained us buoyantly under condi&#8211;
                   tions that would have plunged an older commu&#8211;
                   nity into slums. There were carefully nur&#8211;
                   tured women, who would have gone hungry
                   that first year of the Panic, if husbands and
                   brothers had not been good shots to keep the
                   family larder filled with prairie chicken and
                   ducks. I know of one woman who, for six
                   weeks before her first child was born, lived
                   alone in a prairie shanty on the outskirts of
                   the city with nothing to eat but potato meal.
                   An editor, who at the time represented the
                   city in the Federal Government and who used
                   to cheer the community's heart by thunderous
                   editorials on the glorious of the West,
                   would have gone hungry that winter of <time>'93</time>if
                   <quote>the boys</quote>had not suspected that <quote>the old
                   man</quote>looked gaunt. They got up a shooting
                   party and sent him a present of half a dozen
                   barrels of wild geese. I have heard him <quote>in
                   his cups</quote>curse the hands that were feeding
                   him; but nobody replied; and nobody told; and
                   the friendships cemented in such hardships
                   were embedded in a reinforced concrete.</p>
                   <p>I am stating these circumstances to make it
                   clear that we were face to face with <emph rend="italics">realitites,
                   </emph>not <emph rend="italics">theories</emph>; and <emph rend="italics">the beautiful thing about a
                   reality is that it never lies.</emph> You learn to look 
                   at facts without blinders; without side&#8211;step&#8211;
                   ping or flinching. A woman, who has always
                   lived the mural existence of a protected home,
                   is so terribly apt to mistake what <emph rend="italics">"she thinks"</emph>
                   for great fact of <emph rend="italics">"what is."</emph> If she doesn't
                   like a fact, she shuts her eyes to it. You can't
                   do that when you are bumping into facts that
                   you don't like. So it was not all a disadvant&#8211;
                   tage that the hard times taught us to face facts
                   unflinchingly.</p>
                   <p>One of the curious features of the collapse
                   was its reaction on what the study chair the&#8211;
                   orists call <quote>woman's sphere.</quote> Those were the
                   days, when all the public prints were full of
                   blasts and counterblasts of argument as to 
                   whether woman ought to go out of the home to 
                   become a wage&#8211;earner. We hadn't time for
                   those arguments then in the West. We were
                   not confronted with arguments. We were face
                   to face with hunger. We had to work, or
                   starve. <quote>Ought not woman to stay in her
                   own sphere of manufacturing babies?</quote>the dis&#8211;
                   putants would has truculently. We hadn't any
                   time to answer. We had to go out and work,
                   or see the babies, that were already manufac&#8211;
                   tured, go hungry. <emph rend="italics">It seems to me that is typi&#8211;;
                   cal of the whole woman movement. It isn't a
                   rebellion, a revolt, a megalomania of individ&#8211;
                   ualism run riot, the morbid monstrosity of a 
                   woman trying to be a man, to grow side&#8211;whis&#8211;
                   kers and wear trousers. It is a new economic
                   arena, into which woman has been forcibly
                   pushed by unbending necessity.</emph></p>
                   <p>Let me give some more examples of that ne&#8211;
                   cessity. In three weeks in that city eleven
                   hundred real estate agents closed their offices
                   and took down their signs. What do you sup&#8211;
                   pose the real estate agents' families did about
                   bread and butter just then? The doctor, who
                   became the most famous surgeon west of the
                   <placeName>Mississippi <ptr xml:id="n6" target="#Mississippi" n="6"/></placeName>
                   preceding the fame of the Mayos,
                   told me that he slept on the chairs in his of&#8211;
                   fice that winter, and except for one mid&#8211;day
                   meal, lived on peanuts and beer and hot Scotch.
                   He died in receipt of an income of <measure type="currency">100,000</measure>a
                   year, of a disease contracted in those starva&#8211;
                   tion days; but what do you imagine his old
                   mother and two elderly sisters, whom he was
                   thought to be supporting, did during that hard
                   stress? They went out as wage earners&#8212;I
                   shall not say how; for that is their affair, not
                   mine;but, to me, the funny feature of it was 
                   that this same doctor was a most uncompro&#8211;
                   missing foe to the woman movement. If his
                   mother and sisters had not worked, he would 
                   not have had even that one mid&#8211;day meal.</p>
                   <p>I think of another case, a convent-bred girl,
                   buxom, clean, laughing, good-natured, capable,
                   with stolid, solid but at the same time the most
                   passionate belief that a woman's only sphere
                   was to be a loving wide and a most multitudi&#8211;
                   nous mother. It is funny how life knocks our 
                   little self&#8211;appointed missions on the head; and
                   when the half&#8211;gods go, beats us, prods us, bay&#8211;
                   onets us up to the altars on our knees before
                   the true! Just when the boom collapsed, this
                   girl's father came to his death either by suicide,
                   or falling in front of a train. Her mother 
                   attested her gried by at once buying on credit 
                   about <measure type="currency">2000</measure>dollars worth of deepest
                   mourning. It was found that the life insur&#8211;
                   ance has lapsed and the whole estate amounted
                   to a horrible minus plus nine younger chil&#8211;
                   dren to fed. If this girl had not thrown her 
                   theories to the winds, and plunged into the 
                   arena of the wage&#8212;earners, the home would
                   have been seized by the sheriff and the family
                   turned on the street. She had to take care of
                   the babies already born, and let the unborn
                   ones take care of themselves. SHe taught kin&#8211;
                   dergarten, coached French, helped a convent
                   in German, and laughed and danced her way
                   along uner the load, and worked doggedly at
                   paying those debts, besides educating and sup&#8211;
                   porting the other nine till they could support
                   themselves. At <measure type="age">thirty eight</measure> she married an
                   Englishman, with a right to sin in the House
                   of Lords. Society sat up aghast, then received
                   her with open arms.</p>

                   <p>He will never know, for instancem that one
                   summer when she was supposed to be in Eu&#8211;
                   rope on a holiday, she was secretly comforting
                   a remote relative, who in the scramble of a 
                   speculative era had landed in the penitentiary.
                   He will never know that once, when she wore
                   her clothes so many seasons that friends mur&#8211;
                   mured, she was using her allowance for dress
                   to shield a woman in disgrace. And I never
                   saw a tear of self&#8211;pity on this worker's face.
                   I never heard her utter one complaint against
                   life. I never heard her blame others for the
                   load bequeathed to her willing shoulders. She
                   once told me that the most worrying duty she
                   ever undertook was her husband's first fam&#8211;

                   and when people leave them to themselves, they

                   <p>So I could go on to tell of hosts of women,
                   shaken out by the Panic, that turned every&#8211;
                   thing upside down, from all their little con&#8211;
                   ventional pigeon holes and sheep cotes and
                   CHines boots. Indeed, the Panic of <time>'93</time>did
                   more than anything else I know, than all the 
                   arguments and pros and cons to take the foot
                   bindings of prejudice, the Chinese boots of
                   tradition, off the feet of Western women.</p>
                   <p> <quote>I couldn't&#8212; I simply couldn't&#8212;become a

                   dustrious women have always been in indus&#8211;
                   try. It is merely that of late years, so many
                   industries have gone out of the home that we
                   have had to sit with empty hands by silent
                   looms, or else follow the industries out of the
                   home to the place where they have gone.</quote></p>
                   <p>It does not sound like a wail of woe from
                   a Sisterhood of Discontent&#8212;does it? In fact,
                   when the Panic shook us all out of our little
                   pigeon holes of prejudice in <time>'93</time>, I do not know
                   of a single woman&#8212;wife, daughter, sister&#8212;ef&#8211;
                   ficient and self&#8211;respecting, who did not put her
                   shoulder to the wheel, to lift finances out of
                   the slough where they had fallen. We did not
                   talk of woman's sphere and domestic virutes. 
                   We rolled up our sleeves and jumped into the
                   arena of work. There were the drum beaters
                   of woe, of course, who talked vaguely of for&#8211;
                   mer grandeur and of the fearful come&#8212;down
                   this pioneer rough&#8212;and&#8212;tumble had been to
                   them; but as they talked, some little slip,
                   unmanicured nails, perhaps, the twist of a
                   word, the slur of an articulation, the wrong
                   tang of slang, a slant of sidewise eyes, put
                   the seal of damnation on their revelation; and
                   we came to know in that hard stress, when
                   every hand was needed to turn, push, pull, oil
                   the wheels of life, that <emph rend="italics">only the nogoods pre&#8211;
                   tended to be too good to work.</emph></p>
                   <p>Into this big free hard arena of Western
                   work, I came as a child from the East. As we
                   none of us get shaken out of our pigeon boxes
                   of prejudice, <emph rend="italics">out of the prisons of our own
                   personality, which are the deepest dungeons of 
                   all,</emph> without a flutter of hopes and fears on
                   callow wings, I may as well set down the facts.
                   They are not pleasant. They were horribly
                   painful; and, as I look back, I loathe myself
                   for having paid any more attention to the pain
                   than a child does to a bump. Of course, if
                   you poultice a bump long enough, you can 
                   make a perpetual tenderness on the spot&#8212;
                   even an ulcer.</p>
                   <p>We had not yet moved West.</p>
                   <p>Always, there had been something in the
                   home that made us children want to play out&#8211;
                   side in the sunlight. We would never stay in.
                   Winter or summer, we wanted to do all our 
                   playing outside. It came to the point where I 
                   would let finger tips poking through holes in 
                   mits freeze before I wold go in to warm up.
                   I didn't want to miss one second of being alive.
                   I did not know then that what drove me to the 
                   sunlight outside was an intangible, indefinable
                   shadow inside. I only new that I was hap&#8211;
                   pier outside; and I carry about with me to this
                   day two slightly stubbed finger tips from freez&#8211;
                   ings and thawings, which I would never ac&#8211;
                   knowledge. I knew that each of the brothers
                   had left home just as soon as he could obtain
                   a position yielding a living. I knew that the
                   sisters were kept away at school as long as
                   the money could be made to last. Fortunately,
                   it did not last down to me; so that I stayed 
                   at home long enough to learn what the shadow
                   was inside that frove the children outside. </p>
                   <p>We lived in a very beautiful country border&#8211;
                   ing the lower of one of the Great Lakes. The
                   passion for the outdoors made friends for me
                   of every horse, cow, dog, cat, chickenand bird
                   on the place. If I had not been the youngest,
                   I suppose I should have annexed the baby to
                   this list, too. I knew more intimately than I
                   knew human playfellows, the blue warblers,
                   that call flute notes in June, the yellow finches
                   that chirp and twitter late in July, the long
                   wedge-shaped lines of wild geese that pilfer
                   wheat lands in autumn; and I have lain in the
                   fields, whistling back their call by the hour. 
                   If you lie very still, wild birds are full of curi&#8211;
                   osity, especially crows and geese; and to see
                   how near you could bring the ganders honk&#8211;
                   ing down on investigating tours would send the
                   most delicious thrills of adventure up and
                   down a child's spine. How I escaped accident
                   in the stables, I don't know; for neither my
                   parents nor the hired hands could keep me out
                   of the danger zome. I took extemporized rides
                   on broad backed Durham cows that <quote>hooked.</quote>
                   I never went round a horse's heels when un&#8211;
                   watched. I dodged through under their bodies
                   and was never kicked. A showy pet carriage
                   horse once lifted me with his teeth; but a thick
                   coat protected the shoulder bone; and once a
                   young heaby draught Clydesdale gave my par&#8211;
                   ents the scare of their lives. I had gone to a
                   back field to summon the hired man. The good
                   natured fellow put me on the colt's back. I 
                   was curious to know whether so heavy a draft
                   horse could gallop. The young man was en&#8211;
                   gaged shutting the railroad gate that led up
                   the lane. I gave that horse a kick in the soft
                   of the flank, where the gentlest horse on earth
                   will suffer no liberties; and I don't think he
                   stopped demonstrating his kicking abilities at
                   both ends for the length of a mile. He had the 
                   time of his life for ten full minutes</p>
                   <p><quote>Hang on, don't let go,</quote>came a terrified
                   yell behind. The young fellow was afraid to 
                   pursie for fear of sending the obstreperous 
                   colt over the fence.</p>
                   <p><quote>Well, miss,</quote>he admonished confidentially
                   later, <quote>I guess you learned when you've raised

                   your neck</quote></p>
                   <p>I had. The lesson proved useful later, when
                   we all went through that Western Panic.</p>
                   <p>The constant companionship with living real
                   things gives a child a curious indifference to
                   dead things&#8212;that is, dead ones that should be
                   alive; dolls that do nothing but roll beautiful 
                   <quote>goo eyes</quote>and squeak out inane remarks;
                   rocking horse toys, that romp round a room
                   kicking their heels and back again, never get&#8211;
                   ting anywhere. I had never the slightest in&#8211;
                   terest in make&#8211;believe toys. If they put them
                   in my Christmas stocking, I threw them behind
                   the door. Once an uncle fresh from England
                   with very pronounced English ideas about
                   proper training for girls <pc>(he was a bachelor,
                   of course)</pc>took me in hand with a good scold&#8211;
                   ing about contempt for dolls&#8212;<quote>Little girls
                   ought to like dolls; because dolls were little
                   girls' babies.</quote> I told him I loved babies;
                   but dolls were cheats; they couldn't do a thing
                   but roll their eyes. He departed in disgust. I
                   sat down to ponder. THis stupid wax thing in
                   my hand had brought undeserved rebuke.
                   Criminals in human life were hanged, whether
                   by heels or head I did not know; but I took
                   a spool of thread and hanged that stupid wax&#8212;
                   faced idiot by the heels to the door knob. Then,
                   I went out to the real things, the pups and
                   the kittens and the colts. After that Christ&#8211;
                   mas, no more inane toys fell to my lot. I was
                   given full bent with living real things. Poor
                   Uncle Jim! He is an old man now, but still 
                   advising other people on their morals and
                   their manners; but he has made a failure of
                   life. It has blinked him with <quote>goo</quote>eyes all
                   the way through&#8212;wax&#8211;faced cheates that melt
                   in heat, and break in stress, not realities with 
                   whom, if you <quote>raise the devil, you have to 
                   hang on or break your neck.</quote></p>
                   <p>That love of realities bred by God's gift of
                   staunch animal freinds has stuck through life;
                   sometime, a horribly uncomfortable thing,
                   like a burr in my chest; then again, a pilor
                   star to a promised land. In after like when
                   meeting doll&#8211;types; wax&#8211;faced, soft&#8211;haired,
                   eyes limpid as sky&#8211;water, with display of all
                   the little doll graces, tinkling ear&#8211;rings, a show
                   of pearly teeth, a roll of expressionless eyes,
                   inane remarks, the old feeling of affront would
                   come back; and I have never seen what is
                   known as the doll type of man without recalling
                   these rocking horse toys that couldn't do any&#8211;
                   thinkg but just romp round and back again. Is
                   this, too, typical of the changed attitude in
                   woman's outlook on life, of her reaching out
                   past make&#8211;believes to realities? Is she going
                   to break out of her doll house?</p>
                   <p>There were rare good days spent in the 
                   open meadows with the whole dumb world for
                   playfellows. Sundays in good weather were
                   spent under a big willow in an old garden lis&#8211;
                   tening to story books. When the autumn and
                   spring rains came, we became discoverers of
                   unknown worlds rafting uncharted seas on voy&#8211;
                   ages across swollen brooks and mud puddles.
                   There were no <quote> merry&#8211;go&#8211;rounds</quote>or <quote>shoot
                   the chutes</quote>; but we did attempt running Ni&#8211;
                   agara by sliding down a water spout during a
                   plunging shower straight into the rain barrel.
                   Outsiders and grown&#8211;ups were not invited to
                   this function. THe exigencies of the case re&#8211;
                   quired exit by a low roof window and <quote>night&#8211;
                   ies</quote> tied à la Turkish<foreign><ptr xml:id="n9" target="#à la Turkish" n="9"/></foreign> 
                   costume. The acrobat able to endure longest under the deluge of the
                   spout was awarded highest applause. THere
                   were sugarings off in the maple woods in
                   spring, when taffy on bass wood chips and taf&#8221;;
                   fy in belts of elastic syrup hardening to the
                   frost got inextricably tangled in pig tail hair
                   and red&#821;;riding&#821;;hoods. These celebrations were
                   usually held by starlight round a huge log fire.
                   That out&#8211;door world afforded little feet a 
                   chance to chase real adventure and real ro&#8211;
                   mance down the real paths of everyday life;
                   and I never see the feet of youth on the age&#8211;
                   less quest of ramnce along city streets, but I
                   know that if we children had been norn in the
                   gutter and those children of the city streets
                   had been born to our open meadows&#8212;we, too,
                   would have mistaken painted wax faces and 
                   make&#8211;believe hobby horses for the real thing,
                   and come to age cheated of youth.</p>
                   <p>There comes a time when we know that we
                   have suddenly awakened to a realization of
                   life. The awakening may come in a great joy,
                   or a great love, or a great sorrow, or all three;
                   so that we hardly know whether the pain of
                   love is greater than its joy, or the joy greater
                   than its pain; but when for a moment the veil
                   of things lifts, we fall on our faces before
                   Life.</p>
                   <p>I had known that the others of the family
                   as they came to their early teens, scattered
                   from the home nest. I had come to know that
                   the shadow in the home was deepening; but
                   what it was, childhood could not define. The
                   English uncle had gone West. Our father had
                   gone West. The whole country from Atlan&#8211;
                   tic to Pacific of <time>'93</time>. Everybody was hard up.
                   Financial worry had come to be a constant in&#8211;
                   visible presence in the home; but it was not
                   that.</p>
                   <p>The revelation came one beautiful spring
                   day, when the mist was on the meadows and
                   among the cobwebby tender green of the May
                   foliage. It was SUnday. WHen we had all
                   been polished and furbished up to go off to
                   some church festival instead of passing the 
                   afternoon under the willow tree, I had a feeling
                   that we were being packed off for some reason.
                   Our father had come back to make arrange&#8211;
                   ments to move us West; and somehow there
                   was something in the air. I couldn't help sus&#8211;
                   pecting that both my mother and father were
                   mentally distressed. I ran round to the back
                   of the house and came unheard on my mother
                   standing very still by a rain pool in the or&#8211;
                   chard. SHe did not see me in time to hide the 
                   secret revelaed on her face. I had caught 
                   the expression on the face reflected in the pool be&#8211;
                   for she looked up. It was despair of life; the
                   utter end of hope; heartbreak mute for a life
                   time. She did not speak. Neither did I. I
                   was not ten years old; and childhood fell away
                   like a worn cloak from that day.</p>
                   <p>I knew; and yet I could not have told what 
                   I knew. I knew from that day that I must
                   earn. I knew from that day that I must fight,
                   that <emph rend="italics">there is no peace without a victory,</emph> that
                   <quote>he who fights and runs away and lives to
                   fight another day,</quote>might just as well <emph rend="italics">fight
                   the fight at the first challenge of fate,</emph> and win
                   or die trying to win; for <emph rend="italics">if he runs away,there
                   is no hiding place in Heaven or Hell&#8212;defeat
                   will pursue him.</emph>Sooner or later he must turn
                   and make his stand, and do or die. It isn't
                   as we would have it. IT is as lie ordains. I 
                   knew that Phantom Fright and Want and that
                   tragedy of all tragedies&#8212;a living one, a hope&#8211;
                   less chasm between husband and wife&#8212;had
                   come menacing our happiness like satyr ghosts
                   stealing out of the dark. I knew from that day
                   that I must protect the home; or see it de&#8211;
                   stroyed; and is not that typical of <measure type="number">ninety-nine</measure>
                   cases out of a <measure type="number">hundred</measure>, where girls and women
                   become wage&#8211;earners, where they enter the
                   arena called <quote>industry</quote>?</p>
                   <p><emph rend="italics">It is not a matter of choice. Therefore cease
                   arguing about it. It is a matter of force.
                   Therefore, let us see that the conditions are
                   made right</emph>&#8212;that the girl is as well protected
                   outside the home as in it, and that she goes
                   forth equipped with the only weapon that will 
                   win the Battle of Life&#8212;efficiency, physical and 
                   mental. It did not matter in the least whether
                   I was able to earn, able to fight, able to pro&#8211;
                   tect. I had to, whether I was able or not. If
                   I was not able, then I must make myself able.</p>
                   <p>I did not realize then that every member of
                   our family had not been born with several very
                   serious handicaps; too many nerves, too little
                   nerve; more brains than brawn, which fore&#8211;
                   ordains tradegy just as soon as the hard test 
                   of life's scramble up and down hill begins to
                   shake the flimsy machinery to pieces; and a
                   very pronounced tendency to weak lungs on
                   both sides of the house. Against thes handi&#8211;
                   caps should be set three distinct advantages.
                   First, we all had the advantage of that out&#8211;
                   door life, of training in realities, that never lie
                   and never cheat. Fools we have been all of 
                   us, many times. Blunders we have made ga&#8211;
                   lore, so that I have come to the pass where,
                   though I ask God to forgive my sins because I 
                   can't forgive them myself, ten times more I 
                   ask Him to wipe out my blunders; for I
                   wouldn't forgive them if I could. And I think
                   we've all been inclined slightly to be soft
                   heads. We have had had to learn to be hard, to
                   realize that though diamond and charcould are
                   composed of the very same thinkg, it is the dia&#8211;
                   mond that is hard. Training in out&#8211;door re&#8211;
                   alities taught us all truth and integrity. I
                   mean the kind of truth so that you realize that
                   you must not lie to yourself. Another advan&#8211;
                   tage was my mother's belief that innocence is 
                   no protection unless it is the innocence of
                   knowledge as distinguished from the innocence
                   of ignorance. She did not believe that a boy 
                   could know what evils to shun or why, a girl
                   what dangers or why, unless taught what the 
                   signs of the evils and dangers were, instead od
                   learning by experience, when it is too late.
                   We all stepped into the arena of life knowing
                   the signs to shun and why.</p>
                   <p>There was another advantage very hard to
                   define but we all went out in the world 
                   equipped with it. My mother had a peculiar,
                   almost uncanny, Cletic clairvoyant power to
                   project the image of her personality with us
                   all through life. In stress, in turmoil, in joy,
                   in tight places of complicated decision, we have
                   all felt her invisibly behind us, not advising,
                   but shedding a sort of spiritualist and know little
                   about spiritualism; but I knoew that we have
                   all had this consciousness of her influence. It
                   has a peculiarly clarifying, calming effect,
                   when the waters flow below the bridge of life
                   both turbid and tempestuous&#8212;this spirit
                   touch of a love that is&#8212;I cannot say dead; for I
                   know that the presence is with me as really 
                   and tensely to&#8211;day as that afternoon when we
                   stood beside the rain pool in the orchard.</p>
                   <p>I longed to grow up. I grudged the min&#8211;
                   utes till I could earn. If I could have taken 
                   a dagger and stabbed these Phantom FOes
                   menacing out of the dark, I would gladly have
                   died for the privilege of giving the death 
                   stroke; but the trouble is <emph rend="italics">seeing red and going
                   out to kill&#8212;doesn't help. It's hustling that
                   helps.</emph></p>
                   <p>My mother did not speak. Neither did I as 
                   we linked arms and went up the back stairs.
                   At the landing she turned.</p>
                   <p><quote>Aren't you going to the festival?</quote></p>
                   <p>I should my head. We entered the room; and
                   I flung my arms about her, but could not utter
                   the question on my lips, any more than she
                   could muster up evasive words to delude child&#8211;
                   hood back into blind happiness. I laid my head
                   on her shoulder. There were no tears. Though
                   tears have come to my eyes and throat since,
                   from that day to this, I have literally never
                   shed a tear. What I wanted to ask, what I 
                   wanted to hurl at the very throne of God, was
                   the question&#8212;Is it common lot of woman
                   to suffer in mute heartbreak? Is suffering
                   an inevitable and necessay part of her lot?
                   Does it do any good, this suffering? What's
                   it for? why? I have been seeing the an&#8211;
                   swers to those questions all my life, <emph rend="italics">answers
                   in face, not argument;</emph>and I should like to bo&#8211;
                   row the angel Gabirel's trumpet to sound
                   abroad the answer that I've found. It would
                   needs be a golden instrument with the mellow
                   notes of ahunter's horn or the glad shout of
                   disimprisoned waters in spring to voice the
                   answers I have found.</p>
                   <p>And isn't that typical too, of this whole
                   woman movement? Aren't the women moving
                   uncertainly on untired feet to untried goals&#8212;
                   seekers? And aren't the wailers, the para&#8211;
                   sites, the sisterhoods of discontent weak ones             
                   lost in the dark, shivering at Phantom Fears
                   they will neither fight nor face> That was my
                   first glimmering of the great economic fact,
                   which the world has barely yet sighted that
                   women in industry, te economic independence
                   of women, if you like to put it that way is not
                   the repudiation of womanhood and the func&#8211;
                   tions of womanhood, but is the building of a
                   fortress of security round about womanhood
                   against brutality and force and hunger; is a
                   guarantee of the right of eveyr man child and
                   every woman child to be love&#821;;born.</p>
                   <p>And in a few weeks we had joined the great
