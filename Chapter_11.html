Chapter XI
<h1>An Awakening, or a Revolt?</h1>
<p>And now we come back to those questions with which this narrative of facts in life
set out. Are there any more happy women left on this good green earth ? Do all those
married wish to escape from the cage? Do all those unmarried wish to break into the
cage? Is suffering, such suffering as Jean Ingelow <a id="n8" href="#JeanIngelow">*</a> and Felicia Hemans <a id="n9" href="#FeliciaHemans">*</a> voiced , a necessary part of woman 's lot? Is
there any virtue, except the virtue of the sheep-type, cowed through stupidity , or
timidity , in suffering by women ? Does that suffering help or hurt the race ? Is
there a reason on earth why any child should be born in sadness, instead of
gladness, with the taint of sadness in its blood and the shadow of tragedy across
its soul, instead of that joy and light which brood over the dawn of all nature's
days ? Is the unrest among women a revolt; or an awakening? Or is it a re adjustment
to new conditions? </p>
<p>And these questions are all answered before they are asked. You have but to strip
the
facts behind them free of pretence and argument; and the interrogation mark behind
the question changes to an exclamation of glad surprise. Women are to -day what they
have been throughout the history of the race - good wives, good mothers, good "
pals, &#x201d; good sweet hearts, good sisters. Women in industry are no new thing. Women
have been in industry since time began; and the women, who have gone out to factory
, to office , to school room , to hospital, to clinic, to platform are but doing,
outside the home, what their mothers and grandmothers did inside the home. To take
three-quarters of woman 's vocations outside the home, and to leave her with
manacled hands inside the home, would be to let her beat her life out against the
cave wall of a prison cell in an idleness that would be madness. </p>
<p>What, then , of the unrest? What of the wail of woe from the married ; from the un
married ; from the idle , who want to work ; and the workers, who want to idle ?
Growth is attended with growing pains. Children awakening have been known to be
querelous <a id="n1" href="#querulous">*</a>. Ma chinery being readjusted
often creaks and jolts. The hour of all the twenty - four, when the fever falls and
the patient takes the turn to recovery and strength is always the darkest hour, just
before the dawn. If you know anything about the wonderful secret life of the dumb
creation , you will know it is the hour when the animals turn restlessly , when the
deer steal from their thickets , when the song birds stab the night air with strange
notes before the chorus that greets full day. </p>
<p> So do I see it of our own age! Consider the marvelous complexities of the age in
which we live ! </p>
<p> Formerly, when a woman wished a garment, she carded her own wool. She spun over her
own loom . She sewed the cloth with her own hands. To-day, she must not only go out
of the home to spin the wool; but she can spin only by permission of the owner of
a
huge machine, often only by permission of a huge corporation , which controls the
means of livelihood of thousands like herself. So of the other vocations that have
gone out of the home. Service , she seeks ; Service of the Race , which is the only
avenue to Happiness for any human being, rich or poor, fit or misfit ; and that
Service she can obtain only by the permission of some other human being. Sometimes
she fails to find it altogether, whether she be rich or poor, married or single.
Then , there results the scrap heap, the untellable tragedy of an utterly wasted
life , the desert-dried soul, wind -tossed and tempestuous <a id="n2" href="#tempestuous">*</a>, drab-gray as the arid dust unwatered by the
gladness of giving and getting happiness, whether in the passion ate ecstasies of
love, or those other as passionate ecstasies of devotion to some work. Is it any
wonder there are jolt, clamor, discord ? The seekers for Service are lost seeking
&#x2014;
that is all ; and he, or she, who can shed one shaft of radiance to light them to
their place, will be the truest helper of to -day . I do not think the scolds will
do much. Women are asking &#x201c; What must I do to be saved ; to be saved from Self ? &#x201d;
&#x201c;
What must I do to find some thing to do that is worth while ? " And the scolds are
saying, &#x201c; Go back and be married &#x201d; ; &#x201c; Go and get unmarried &#x201d; ; &#x201c; Drop industrial
work and go back to the home&#x201d; ; &#x201c; Drop the home and go out to a vocation .&#x201d; Women
are asking &#x2014; &#x201c; What must I do to be saved from Self ; to find something to do that
is worth while &#x201d; ; and for bread and meat and light, the scolds are proffering the
serpent-envenomed tongue lashing of an ancient fish -wife . I am not keen on the
scolds. I don't think they will get us anywhere, for the simple reason that what has
happened has not resulted from conscious choice . It has resulted from the
compulsion of necessity . </p>
<p>Take the unnatural conditions under which much industry is conducted ! There are
factories where as many as 9,000 men are employed without a single woman . There are
factories where as many as 5 ,000 women are employed under a few dozen men . The
grand fathers and grandmothers of these men and women worked together in their
vocations. In America, they even worked together in their Indian Wars <a id="n3" href="#IndianWars">*</a> and the subjugation of the wilderness ;
in monastic foundation and Quaker assembly <a id="n4" href="#Quakerassembly">*</a> . To-day, such industrial life has bifurcated <a id="n5" href="#bifurcated">*</a> the race , with detriment that need not be given
here. How we shall work it out remains to be seen ; but one highest Service to the
Race is practically handicapped . Is it surprising there results unrest? </p>
<p>And we are no longer going it blind . Afore time, the imbecile was ascribed to the
mysterious Will of God . ( I know of twelve imbeciles in one reformatory born of one
degenerate mother, all ascribed under the old order to that mysterious Will of a
capricious <a id="n6" href="#capricious">*</a> God.) The unfit, the
prenatal failures, the prenatal criminals all were ascribed to Deity . We no longer
utter these pious blasphemies. We stand up to the realization of our own human sins
and blunders. We are doing so much to protect the unfit, we realize that if we do
not lessen the supply, our race will be swamped ; and that brings us under one of
the most piercing searchlights that ever illuminated the path of the race.
Searchlights as a rule are supposed to light up the path behind . This one searches
the way to the fore. We demand not only the protection of the unfit, but the
protection of the unborn. This may mean a decreased birth rate as to numbers. We can
stand a decreased birth rate as to quantity if it means a higher average as to
quality . Athens, not China, typifies civilization for us. </p>
<p> Nor do I see a symptom of decadence <a id="n7" href="#decadence">*</a> in
modern divorce . We called appendicitis by an other name long ago and let the
patient die . To-day, we apply the surgeon's knife and save the life . I see in
divorce not evidence of secret vice, but a life-saving knife. The Service of the
Race is the only criterion by which we can judge it; and God is served best, not by
kow -towing to what others may think, not by taking out an insurance policy for
ourselves to secure a future Heaven of which we can know nothing , but by securing
as much as possible of the Kingdom of Heaven for others and our selves on this
earth. </p>
<p>Granted it may all mean a new chivalry, a new womanhood, a new race, a new religion
.
Have we so little faith in the old that we fear for the full flower that may burgeon
in the new ? </p>
